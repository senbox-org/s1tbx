<h3>General F.A.Q.</h3>
<h4>What SAR products are supported?</h4><p>NEST supports ENVISAT, ERS-1, ERS-2, and RADARSAT-2 fully.</p><p>NEST also supports TerraSAR-X, Cosmo-Skymed, ALOS PALSAR, RADARSAT-1 and JERS with the exception of some special product types.</p><p>For more details on what product types are supported, please refer to the <a href="http://www.array.ca/nest-web/docs/Supported_Products_4B-1.0.xls">supported products spreadsheet</a>.</p><h4>How is NEST licenced?</h4><p>NEST is licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a><br></p><h4>If I write an application using NEST API am I forced to distribute that application?</h4><p>No.
The license gives you the option to distribute your application if you
want to. You do not have to exercise this option in the license.<br></p><h4>If I wanted to distribute an application using NEST what license would I need to use?</h4><p>The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a><br></p><h4>I am a commercial user. Is there any restriction on the use of NEST?</h4><p>NEST can be used internally ("in-house") without restriction, but only redistributed in other software that is under the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a> unless permission is granted from all copyright holders. </p>
<h4>I can't open an ENVISAT product.</h4><p>First, try to open the products with Enviview <a href="http://earth.esa.int/enviview/"><font color="blue" size="3"><u>http://earth.esa.int/enviview/</u></font></a>.
If that works then it could be a version not supported by NEST. Let us
know and we'll try to get it supported asap. If both Enviview and NEST are
not able to read the product, then it could be that the file is corrupt
or compressed.&nbsp;</p><p>Some
users have had difficulty when decompressing files using Winzip.
Deactivate the CR/LF translation option in winzip (this option is
activated by default).</p><h4>When I open a RADARSAT-2 image I don't get any metadata</h4><p>A
RADARSAT-2 product should be opened through it's product.xml file to
ensure that the RADARSAT-2 product reader will recognize all files and
import the whole product.</p><h4>How do I import a PolSARPro result?</h4><p>Use
the PolSARPro reader and select the folder containing all the indivual
band files. When imported, all individual bands will show up within one
product.</p><h4>What method is used for Oil Spill Detection?</h4><p>The
method currently implemented in NEST for oil spill detection is an
adaptive thresholding dark spots detection algorithm. It first
estimates the mean backscatter level in a large window, then set a
threshold which is k decibel below the estimated mean backscatter
level. Pixels with backscatter&nbsp; values lower than the threshold
are considered as potential oil spill. Finally the detected pixels are
clustered and discriminated. Only those clusters that are larger enough
will be saved as detection result. Here in the algorithm, the user has
fully control of the window size for estimating the mean backscatter
level, the parameter k for setting the threshold, and the minimum
cluster size.<br>&nbsp;<br>The method is based on the following
reference in which a much more complicated pyramid approach was
proposed. In NEST however one level detection is implemented.<br><br>&nbsp;A.
S. Solberg, C. Brekke and R. Solberg, "Algorithms for oil spill
detection in Radarsat and ENVISAT SAR images", Geoscience and Remote
Sensing Symposium, 2004. IGARSS '04. Proceedings. 2004 IEEE
International, 20-24 Sept. 2004, page 4909-4912, vol.7.</p><h4>Can I use the Apply-Orbit-File Operator on JERS-1, Radarsat-1. ALOS, etc.?</h4><p>No.
The orbit corrections are only for ENVISAT, ERS-1 and ERS-2.&nbsp;If
the orbit state vectors in your products are not accurate then this
would be a problem when orthorectifying. You should be using the
SARSimulation Terrain Correction to coregister your image with a
simulated SAR image generated from the DEM and then terrain correcting.</p><h4>What external DEM does NEST support?</h4><p>Currently only WGS84-latlong
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-GB">(</span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-GB">P</span></i><span style="font-size: 7pt; font-family: Symbol;" lang="EN-GB">&#1488; </span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-GB">, P</span></i><span style="font-size: 7pt; font-family: Symbol;" lang="EN-GB">&#1488;</span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-GB">, P</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-GB">h</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-GB">)</span>&nbsp;DEM&nbsp;in meters is accepted as geographic system. User can specify one tile (i.e. one file) of the DEM.</p><h4>What are the definitions of local incidence angle and projected local incidence angle?</h4><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-GB"></span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-GB"></span></i><span style="font-size: 7pt; font-family: Symbol;" lang="EN-GB"></span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-GB"></span></i><span style="font-size: 7pt; font-family: Symbol;" lang="EN-GB"></span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-GB"></span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-GB"></span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-GB"></span> The
local incidence angle is defined as the angle between the normal vector
of the backscattering element (i.e. vector perpendicular to the ground
surface) and the incoming radiation vector (i.e. vector formed by the
satellite position and the backscattering element position).</p><p>The projected local incidence angle is defined as the angle between the
incoming radiation vector (as defined above) and the projected surface
normal vector into range plane. Here range plane is the plane formed by
the satellite position, backscattering element position and the earth
center.</p><p>For
more information on the definitions, derivations and calculations of
the angles please see section 14.3.4 in "SAR Geocoding: Data and
Systems" by Gunter Schreier.</p><h4>In coregistration I get "Not enough valid GCPs in slave". How can I fix this?</h4><p>Some
products can have a significant error in their georeferencing. You may
need to set the coarse registration window in the GCP Selection tab to
something larger such as 512 or 1024. Also, increasing the number of
GCPs will give you a better chance of having more surviving. For fine
registration, you could reduce the coherence threshold. In the warp,
check 'show residuals' to see a summary of where GCPs are being shifted
to and what their RMS values are. Set the RMS threshold to a value where you can get lots of representative GCPs at the smallest RMS.</p><h4>I've closed my tool views (world map, layer manager, navigation, etc). How can I get them back?</h4><p>In the top menu go to View -&gt; Manage Layout and select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reset Layout</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Load Tabbed Layout</span>.</p><h4>Why can I not orthorectify my image over the Arctic?</h4><p>It
will depend on the DEM and output map projection. The default SRTM DEM
is only available from +60 to -60 deg latitude. At the polar regions
you will need to use either the low resolution GETASSE30, ASTER GDEM up
to 83 deg or your own external DEM. Also, for the polar regions, using
a polar map projection will give you a better result.</p><h4>Is training and support available for NEST?</h4><p>ESA
provides introductory training at some conference workshops and support
for technical problems through the NEST website forum. Personalized
training courses and technical support subscriptions are available by
contacting <a href="mailto:nest_pr@array.ca?Subject=NEST_Support">Array</a>.</p>
