<h3>NEST Architecture</h3>







<p class="Paranum" style="">NEST&nbsp;consists of a collection of processing modules and data product readers and
writers. </p>



<p class="Paranum" style="">All
modules are centered on the Generic Product Model (GPM) of the BEAM-NEST
Core.&nbsp; The GPM is a common, unified data
model designed so that all data readers convert data into this data model and
all analysis and processing tools use this data model exclusively.</p>
<p class="Paranum" style="">Data product reader modules&nbsp;ingest all the data of a particular product, including metadata and
transform it into the GPM data structure. The GPM is abstract enough to
handle all types of data products without losing any information. The
NEST tools&nbsp;have only one interface to the GPM in order to work
with the data. Data product writers are able to take the data from the
GPM and produce an external file format. With a GPM, file conversions
from one file format to another are easily achieved with the
appropriate reader and writer modules. Furthermore, the DAT, tools and
future plug-ins are not&nbsp;dependent on which data products are supported
or any specific complexities of the file formats. </p>



<p class="Paranum" style="">NEST&#8217;s
primary goal is to read in ESA and
third part SAR data products, provide tools for calibration, orthorectification, co-registration,
interferometry, and data manipulation, and then convert the data into common
file formats used by other 3rd party SAR software.</p>

<h3>Built on Beam</h3>



<p class="Paranum" style="">The NEST
architecture is built upon the proven and extensible architecture of BEAM.
&nbsp;BEAM features an Application Programming
Interface (API) that was
designed and developed from the beginning to be used by 3rd parties
to extend BEAM or re-use it in their own applications.</p>

<p class="Paranum" style="">BEAM is an application suite which
facilitates the
utilization, viewing and processing of MERIS, AATSR and ASAR data
products of
the ESA ENVISAT environmental satellite. &nbsp;It provides a multitude
of tools and functions to visualize, analyze, manipulate and modify
earth
observation data. </p>

</div>



<p class="Paranum" style="">Although BEAM has
been intended specifically for optical data, the BEAM architecture has been
designed and developed to facilitate the extension and re-use of its code base
such that it is feasible to use BEAM&#8217;s core framework as the building blocks to
develop a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) toolbox.</p>



<p class="Paranum" style="">NEST and BEAM&nbsp;share a
common core that enables the exchange of modules between the two toolboxes. &nbsp;This
common core is&nbsp;maintained cooperatively by both Array Systems Computing
Inc., the developers of NEST and Brockmann Consult, the developers of BEAM. </p>

<p class="Paranum" style="">The majority of the NEST functionality
is encapsulated in BEAM plug-in modules. &nbsp;As such, some modules are interchangeable
between the two systems.</p>
