<h3>BEAM-NEST Core</h3>


<p class="Paranum" style=""><span style=""><span class="msoIns"></span></span>The common BEAM-NEST Core architecture
consists of various plug-in modules which are&nbsp;independently developed,
modified and versioned. &nbsp;The core
framework is made up of the beam-core,
beam-gpf, beam-processing, beam-ui and beam-visat modules.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 646px; height: 416px;" alt="Beam-Nest Core" src="images/beam-nest_core.jpg"><br>

</div>
<p class="Paranum" style="">The
core modules make use of ceres-core, ceres-ui and ceres-binding. These modules
package utility classes for module registration, versioning, application
building and swing user interface helper functions.</p>


<p class="Paranum" style="">The beam-core contains most of
the managers and data model including the data IO for the product readers and
format writers. &nbsp;The beam-gpf is the Graph Processing Framework (GPF), which implements
the new processing framework introduced in version 4 of the software. &nbsp;Processing tasks are implemented as Operators.
&nbsp;The GPF provides a way to execute a
chain of sequential processing steps on an image. &nbsp;The beam-processing
is the old version 3 processing framework, which will not be used by NEST
directly but may still have dependencies for some BEAM operators. &nbsp;The beam-ui
provides the user interface framework for creating applications, windows and
dialogs. &nbsp;Beam-visat is the primary application and user interface to the
tools in BEAM. &nbsp;VISAT supports extensions
for views for displaying data,&nbsp;actions to add menu items and toolbar buttons
to trigger user initiated events.</p>
