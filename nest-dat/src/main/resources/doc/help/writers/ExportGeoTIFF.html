<h3>Export GeoTIFF Product</h3>

<p>This command allows to export the data of the current product to a GeoTIFF file.</p>

<p>GeoTIFF is an extension to the TIFF 6.0 specification. These image files contain
    additional information about their georeference and their spatial resolution. A wide range of
    projected coordinate systems are supported including UTM, US State Plane, and National Grids.
    For further information have a look at the following documentation:
</p><ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/geotiff.html">GeoTIFF Homepage</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/tiff/index.html">TIFF Specification</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Constraints on created GeoTIFF product files</h3>

<p>Exported GeoTIFF files contain additional information beside the
tags defined by the GeoTIFF specification. The BEAM-DIMAP header is
used to hold this additional information. This allows a better support
of several&nbsp;features including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Name and type of the product.</li>
    <li>Name, description and unit of each band.</li>
    <li>The properties of no-data and scaling for each band.</li>
    <li>The index coding of a band.</li>
    <li>Virtual and filtered bands.</li>
    <li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For features and limitations of the GeoTIFF export and constraints of interaction with other GIS tools are given in
    the following list:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>All bands of a GeoTiff file must have the same data type.
Therefore a common data type is identified which is suitable for all
bands. Double precision data type is not supported. </li>
    <li>The data of a band is always written raw and unscaled.
    </li>
    <li>Virtual and filtered bands can only be reimported by the Toolbox.</li>
    <li>All projections available in Reprojection are also supported by the GeoTIFF
        writer.
        As a fallback, if a map projection or other geocoding is not directly supported, a tie-point grid is written to
        the GeoTiff file.<br>
        The exported GeoTiff files were tested for compatibility with ENVI and ArcGis. While the files are fully
        compatible with ENVI, ArcGIS has problems to understanding stereographic projections.
    </li>
    <li>An index coded band can only be correctly decoded by other GIS tools, if it is written as an image with one
        band.
    </li>
</ul>
