<h3>Coregistering&nbsp;Products</h3><p>
Image co-registration is fundamental for Interferometry SAR (InSAR)
imaging and its applications, such as DEM map generation and analysis.
To obtain a high quality InSAR image, the individual complex images
need to be co-registered to sub-pixel accuracy.</p><p><br>The
toolbox will accurately&nbsp;co-register one&nbsp;or more&nbsp;slave
images with respect to a master image. The co-registration function is
fully automatic, in the sense that it does not require the user to
manually select ground control points (GCPs) for the master and slave
images.</p><p><br>Images
may be fully or only partly overlapping and may be from acquisitions
taken at different times using multiple sensors or from multiple
passages of the same satellite.</p><p><br>The achievable
co-registration accuracy for images in the same acquisition geometry
and over flat areas will be better than 0.2 pixels for two real images
and better than 0.05 pixels for two complex images.</p><p><br>The image co-registration is accomplished in three major processing steps (see Figure 1) with three operators: <a href="../operators/CollocateOp.html">Create Stack operator</a>,&nbsp;<a href="../operators/GCPSelectionOp.html">GCP Selection operator</a> and&nbsp;<a href="../operators/WarpOp.html">Warp operator</a>. </p><br><img style="width: 404px; height: 448px;" alt="" src="images/coregistration_diagram.jpg"><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">Figure 1. Image co-registration<br></div><h4>Input Images</h4><p>The input images for the co-registration function can be
complex&nbsp;or real. But all&nbsp;images must belong to the same type
(i.e. they must all be complex or all real) and have the same
projection system (all slant range or all ground range projected or all
geocoded). &nbsp; If the images are not in the same projection, the
slave image(s) should be
reprojected into the same projection system as that of the master
image.
</p><h4>Create Stack</h4><p>The
Create Stack operator&nbsp;collocates the master and slave images.
Basically the slave image data is resampled into the geographical
raster of the master image. By doing so the master and slave images
share the same geopositioning information and have the same dimension.
For details of the Create Stack operator,&nbsp;readers are referred to <a href="../operators/CollocateOp.html">Create Stack operator</a>.
For coregistration of detected products it is ok to use the resamling
methods. For coregistration of complex products for interferometry, the
option to not do any resampling in the CreateStack should be used.</p><h4>GCP Selection</h4><p>The
GCP Selection operator then creates an alignment between&nbsp;master
and slave images by matching the user
selected master GCPs to their corresponding slave GCPs. There are two
stages for the operation: coarse registration and fine registration.
For real images co-registration, the coarse registration is applied.
The registration&nbsp;is achieved by maximizing the
cross-correlation between master and slave images on a series of
imagettes defined across the images. For complex image co-registration,
the additional fine registration is applied. The registration is
achieved by maximizing the&nbsp;coherence between master and
slave&nbsp;images at a series
of imagettes defined across the images.&nbsp;For details of
the&nbsp;GCP Selection operator, readers are referred to&nbsp;<a href="../operators/GCPSelectionOp.html">GCP Selection operator</a>.</p><h4>Warp</h4><p>With
the master-slave GCP pairs selected, a warp function is created by the
Warp operator, which&nbsp;maps pixels
in the slave image into pixels in the master image.&nbsp;For details of
the&nbsp;Warp operator, readers are referred to <a href="../operators/WarpOp.html">Warp operator</a>.</p><h4>Co-Registration from the DAT</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detailed steps of using this operator are given below:<br><ol><li>From the SAR Tools menu, select Coregistration.</li><li>Add a master product to the ProductSet Reader.</li><li>Add any slave products to the ProductSet reader or drag and drop products from a Project.</li><li>In the CreateStack tab, select one source band from the master and one
source band from the slave for detected products. If you are using
complex data products, select&nbsp;bands i and q for the master and select
bands i and q from the slaves. &nbsp;For interferometric processing, select no resampling and Master extents in the CreateStack.</li><li>In the GCP Selection tab enter the number of GCPs to create.</li><li>In the Warp tab select the RMS threshold and warp polynomial order.</li><li>In the Target tab enter in the output product name and location.</li><li>Press the Run button to begin processing.</li></ol><br><br><br><br><br><br>
