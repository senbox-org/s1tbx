<h3>Product Library</h3><p>The Product Library tool optimizes the
identification of data products in a database for fast retrievable of
the metadata of locally stored products. Search results are displayed
in a table listing product name, path, mission, product type,
acquisition date, pass, pixel spacing, etc. without actually opening
the original products. The footprint of each image is outlined on the
world map over top of Blue Marble images with a place names vector
layer. Multilooked quicklooks of the images are also generated and
stored in the database for quick previewing.</p><p>The Product Library
can optionally automatically add new metadata to the database whenever
a product is manually opened. The user may also define a list of
repository folders that will be scanned recursively for new or modified
products.</p><p>The product readers of the Toolbox are able to abstract
the metadata from each product into the Generic Product Model of the
Toolbox. Thereby, the Product Library and all processing tools of the
Toolbox are able to work with the metadata in this common form without
requiring the user to manually input any metadata.</p><p>Products may
be searched in terms of mission, product type, beam mode, ground
location, date and time of acquisition, processing history, previously
defined AOIs, and suggested image pairing. Products may also be
searched by graphically drawing an area of interest on the world map
and querying the database for products that cover the AOI.</p><p>The
user may then select from the resulting table of products which
products to open, add to a project, or batch process directly from the
Product Library.</p><p><img style="width: 885px; height: 1061px;" alt="" src="images/productLibrary.jpg"></p><h3>Importing into a Project</h3><p>After having selected the products
you wish to import, press the Import to Project button to convert the
products into DIMAP format and add them to the currently opened
project. If a project is not currently opened you will be prompted to
create a new project.</p><p>If you would like to simply open the
products without converting them into DIMAP format then press the Open
Selected button to add them to the DAT Product View list.</p><h3>Batch Processing</h3><p>To
Batch Process a list of selected products press the Batch Process
button. This will open the Batch Processing dialog and add your
products to the input list. If you right click on the Batch Processing
button, a popup menu will appear with all the&nbsp;graphs from the User
Graphs menu. You may select one and then the Batch Processing dialog
will default to the graph selected.</p><p></p><hr>
