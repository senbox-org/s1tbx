Usage:
  {0} <op>|<graph-file> [options] [<source-file-1> <source-file-2> ...]

Description:
  This tool is used to execute BEAM raster data operators in batch-mode.
  The operators can be used stand-alone or combined as a directed acyclic
  graph (DAG). Processing graphs are represented using XML. More info
  about processing graphs, the operator API, and the graph XML format can
  be found in the BEAM documentation.

Arguments:
  <op>               Name of an operator. See below for the list of <op>s.
  <graph-file>       Operator graph file (XML format).
  <source-file-i>    The <i>th source product file. The actual number of
                     source file arguments is specified by <op>. May be
                     optional for operators which use the '-S' option.

Options:
  -h                 Displays command usage. If <op> is given, the specific
                     operator usage is displayed.
  -t <file>          The target file. Default value is ''{1}''.
  -c <cache-size>    Sets the tile cache size in bytes. Must be greater zero
                     and less than maximum available heap space.
                     Value can be suffixed with ''K'', ''M'' and ''G''.
  -f <format>        Output file format, e.g. ''GeoTIFF'', ''HDF5'',
                     ''BEAM-DIMAP''. If not specified, format will be
                     derived from the target filename extension, if any,
                     otherwise the default format is ''{2}''.
  -p <file>          A (Java Properties) file containing processing
                     parameters in the form <name>=<value>.
  -T<target>=<file>  Defines a target product. Valid for graphs only.
                     <target> must be the identifier of a node in the graph.
                     The node''s output will be written to <file>.
  -S<source>=<file>  Defines a source product. <source> is specified by
                     the operator or the graph. In an XML graph, all
                     occurences of $'{<source>'} will be replaced with
                     references to a source product located at <file>.
  -P<name>=<value>   Defines a processing parameter, <name> is specified by
                     the operator or the graph. In an XML graph, all
                     occurences of $'{<name>'} will be replaced with <value>.
                     Overwrites parameter values specified by the ''-p''
                     option.
  -e                 Displays Java stack trace, if an error occurs.
