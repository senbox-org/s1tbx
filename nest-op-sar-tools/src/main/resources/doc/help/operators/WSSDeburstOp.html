<h3>ASAR WSS Deburst Operator</h3>








For each subswath,&nbsp;the WSS products have many overlapping
&#8216;bursts&#8217; along the flight direction associated with a zero Doppler time for each
range line. <br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 540px; height: 244px;" alt="bursts" src="images/wss_bursts.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
The first step in performing the azimuth debursting is to find all
range lines belonging to the same zero-Doppler time. <br>
<br>
The Operator provides the following options:&nbsp;<br><br>Produce intensities only: The complex data is converted to intensity and the peak of each burst is used.<br>Average intensities: When producing intensities, the coresponding burst lines are mean averaged.<br><br>If
"Product intensities only" is not selected, then complex data will be
produced along with&nbsp;virtual bands for intensity and phase.<br><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-CA">
