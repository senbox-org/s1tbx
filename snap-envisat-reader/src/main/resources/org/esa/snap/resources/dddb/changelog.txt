Replaced "!REF_TBD!" in ./records/meris/MER_FR__1P_ADSR_tie_pt.dd by "num_tie_points_across"
Replaced several "!REF_TBD!" in ./records/meris/MER_FR__2P_MDSR_*.dd by "line_length"

2002/01/17
Replaced "!REF_TBD!" in ./records/meris/MER_FR__1P_ADSR_tie_pt.dd by "num_tie_points_across"
Replaced several "!REF_TBD!" in ./records/meris/MER_FR__2P_MDSR_*.dd by "line_length"

2002/01/07
All files not related to the ENVISAT products considered in the MA-Toolbox
have been removed. This was done in order to reduce the effort of changing
the database format to suit the needs of the MA-Toolbox software components.
These are the remaining product types:
ASA_APG_1P.dd ASA_APM_1P.dd ASA_APP_1P.dd ASA_APS_1P.dd ASA_GM1_1P.dd
ASA_IMG_1P.dd ASA_IMM_1P.dd ASA_IMP_1P.dd ASA_IMS_1P.dd ASA_WSM_1P.dd
ASA_WVI_1P.dd ASA_WVS_1P.dd ASA_WVW_2P.dd
ATS_AR__2P.dd ATS_MET_2P.dd ATS_NL__0P.dd ATS_NR__2P.dd ATS_TOA_1P.dd
MER_FR__1P.dd MER_FR__2P.dd MER_LRC_2P.dd MER_RRC_2P.dd MER_RRV_2P.dd
MER_RR__1P.dd MER_RR__2P.dd

2001/12/04
Initial version obtained from Olivier Colin at ESA/ESRIN. The database was
called ENVISAT Data Dictionary.
