<h4>Exporting a Color Legend Image</h4>

<p>
    For non-RGB images it is possible to export the current colour palette setting as a colour legend image.
    This function is available from the context menu over non-RGB images.
    The menu item <i>Export Color Legend</i> brings up a file chooser dialog allowing you to select
    the file name for the exported legend image. The legend appearance can be modified by opening the
    <i>Properties...</i> button in the file chooser:
</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="images/ColorLegendProperties.jpg" width="362" height="309">
</p>

<p>Note that the tranparency mode is only enabled for the image types TIFF and PNG. A preview dialog
    for the legend image can be opened by clicking the <i>Preview...</i> button. Within the dialog
    it is also possible to copy the colour legend image the the system clipboard by using the context menu
    over the image area:
</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="images/ColorLegendPreview.jpg" width="486" height="195"> 
</p>
