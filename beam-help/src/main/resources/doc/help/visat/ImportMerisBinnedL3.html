<h3>Import MERIS Binned Level-3 Product</h3>


<p>This option allows to import MERIS Binned Level-3 data products into VISAT. These data products
    provide the Level-3 statistics <code>mean</code>, <code>count</code>, <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>
    for a single MERIS Level-2 variable, e.g. Chlorophyll-a on a global, 9 km, integerised sinusoidal (ISIN) grid.
    The statistics for each variable is provided in a single
    <a href="http://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">netCDF</a> file.</p>

<p>For the ease of use, BEAM resamples the global ISIN grid to a global Plate Carr&eacute;e grid (Lat/lon projection).</p>

<p>MERIS Binned Level-3 data products can be freely downloaded from the
    <a href="http://www.enviport.org/meris/lv3_main.htm">MERIS Level-3 Products Website</a>
    (http://www.enviport.org/meris/lv3_main.htm). Please copy the address and use your web-browser
    (e.g. Internet Explorer) to download the products. The download will not work with the browser included
    in this help-system.
    A description of the file format and the ISIN grid can also be found there.</p>
