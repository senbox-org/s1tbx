<h4>The Product Grabber &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/icons/RsProduct16.gif"></h4>

<p>The Product Grabber represents a rigorous simplification of accessing your data products. It
    provides you with a product preview, so you can easily decide which products you want to open or
    import.</p>

<p>You will get the following information on every supported product:
    <ul>
        <li>The file name</li>
        <li>The file size in megabyte</li>
        <li>The product properties containing the product type, product size, the resolution, the scanning
            start time and the center latitude and longitude</li>
        <li>A zoomable Quick Look</li>
        <li>A zoomable World Map showing the location of the respective product on a virtual globe</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/ProductGrabber.jpg"></p>

<p>The Product Grabber organizes your product data directories as repositories. You can simply add a
    new repository by clicking the add button and selecting the desired directory. If the Product
    Grabber searches the selected directory recursively all subdirectories storing supported data
    products will be added to the repository list too. At the next start up of VISAT the Product Grabber
    will remember all added repositories.</p>


<p>To open a data product, simply double click on it or select one or multiple from the table and
    click the open product button.</p>

<p>Click into the Quick Look or World Map to zoom into it.</p>

<p>If you have added or removed data products in the directories storing your products you can
    refresh the selected reposistory by clicking the refresh button.</p>

<p>If you want to remove a repository click the remove button. The remove action will only remove
    the selected repository from the repository list, it will not delete the linked directory on the
    respective data storage.</p>

<p class="inote"><b>Note: </b>The Product Grabber will cache its data in the home directory of the
    active user.You will find the cached data in your home directory in the subdirectory <code>
    /.beam-cache/.productGrabber-Cache</code>
</p>

<p>Each column in the table is sortable. If you click on the column header you can cycle through the
    three modes (none, ascending, descending) of sorting. The columns are sorted by the following
    methods:<br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>File Name:</b> is sorted alphabetically</li>
        <li><b>File Size:</b> is sorted by the size of the product</li>
        <li><b>ProductProperties:</b> is sorted by the type of product</li>
        <li><b>Quick Look:</b> is sorted by the raster height of the product</li>
        <li><b>Location:</b> is sorted by the center point of the product</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>In the following the tool buttons of the Product Grabber are explained.</p>
