<h3>Create DEM-related Bands</h3>

<p>
    This command adds a new DEM-elevation band and optionally DEM-corrected latitude and longitude bands to the current product. <br>
    The bands are computed by looking up each pixel in a selected high-resolution DEM (which is by default GETASSE30).
    In opposite to the <a href="Orthorectification.html">orthorectification</a> tool, which always reprojects the data product,
    the DEM-corrected latitudes and longitudes are computed in the selected product's current coordinate system.

<ul>
    <li><b>Digital elevation model (DEM)</b>
        <br/>Lets you select a DEM from the list of currently installed DEMs.</li>
    <li><b>Elevation band name</b>
        <br/>The name of the new elevation band.</li>
    <li><b>Output DEM-corrected bands</b>
        <br/>Check if DEM-corrected bands shall be created. Depending on the data product type, this option may not be available.</li>
    <li><b>Latitude band name</b>
        <br/>The name of the new DEM-corrected latitude band.</li>
    <li><b>Longitude band name</b>
        <br/>The name of the new DEM-corrected longitude band.</li>
