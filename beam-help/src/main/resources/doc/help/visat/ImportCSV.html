<h2>Import CSV Data</h2>

<p>
    You can import any CSV ('Character Separated Value') data given in plain text files. However, to be correctly imported and
    interpreted by BEAM/Visat, these files need to follow
    certain rules on content and formatting, as described <a href="CsvFileRules.html">here</a>.
    Trying to import CSV files which deviate from these rules may result in unexpected behaviour or error messages.
</p>

<h3 id="defineCRS">Definition of the Coordinate Reference System (CRS)</h3>

<p>When importing a CSV text file, you will be asked to
    define the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) on which the given coordinates are defined.
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/ImportCsvDefineCRS.png">
</p>

<p>
    You can choose between three options to define the CRS:
<ul>
    <li><b>Use target CRS</b><br/>
        This options can be chosen if the CSV data is defined on the same CRS as the product you want
        to import the CSV file in. The transformation used by the projection can be selected. Also the geodetic
        datum and transformation parameters can be set, if possible for the selected transformation.
    </li>
    <li><b>Custom CRS</b><br/>
        Here you can freely define the CRS of the CSV data.
    </li>
    <li><b>Predefined CRS</b><br/>
        By clicking on the <b>Select...</b> button a new <a href="SelectCrsDialog.html">dialog</a> is shown
        where a predefined CRS can be selected.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="interpretPointData"/>Interpretation of Point Data</h3>

<p>
    After the CRS of the CSV data has been selected and confirmed with 'OK', a new dialog 'Point Data Interpretation' is
    shown.
    Here it can be selected in which way the given point data in the file shall be interpreted and displayed
    by BEAM/Visat.
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/PointDataInterpretationDialog.png">
</p>

<p>
    You can choose between the following options:
<ul>
    <li>Leave imported data <b>unchanged</b><br/>
        This option should be chosen if the data shall be taken 'as is'. No further interpretation is done. This is the default.
    </li>
    <li>Interpret each point as vertex of a single <b>line or polygon</b><br>
        (This will remove all attributes from points)<br/>

    </li>
    <li>Further possible interpretations depending on the point data representation in the file, such as<br/>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Interpret each point as <b>pin</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                Interpret each point as <b>track point</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
See more details and examples <a href="CsvFileRules.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
    After the point data interpretation is confirmed with 'OK', the data is displayed in the current view.
    Also, a new vector data node corresponding to this CSV source is added in the Products View, and a new
    vector data and mask layer is added in the <a href="LayerManagerWindow.html">Layer Manager</a>.
