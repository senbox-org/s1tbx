<h3>Export Geometry as Shapefile</h3>

<p>This command allows the export of geometries as ESRI Shapefile.
</p>

<p>When exporting a geometry with different geometry types (Line, Polygone, etc.), than a separate file for
    each type will be created. The type name will be appended to the filename you have entered.
    This results in:
<ul>
    <li>&lt;MyShapeFile&gt;_Line.shp</li>
    <li>&lt;MyShapeFile&gt;_Polygone.shp</li>
    <li>etc.</li>
</ul>
    Also multiple associated files will be created for each shapefile:
<b>*.dbf</b>, <b>*.fix</b>, <b>*.shx</b>, <b>*.prj</b>
