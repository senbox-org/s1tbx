<h4><a name="new">New Product&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/icons/New24.gif"></a></h4>

<p>The new-command allows you to create a new product. The command is enabled only if you have

    The primary use of this command is to create a <a href="ProductSubsetDialog.html">spectral or spatial subset</a> of
    another, open product.</p>

<h4><a name="newTS">New Time Series&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/icons/New24.gif"></a></h4>

<p>The command allows the creation of a time-series product. Multiple source products can build up a time-series. All source must share a common
    coordinate reference system (CRS). If this is not the case the products are reprojected on th fly.</p>

<h4><a name="openSession">Open Session (Control-Shift-O)</a></h4>

<p>Opens a SNAP <a href="Session.html">Session</a> file stored on the hard disk in the Sentinel Toolbox. A session is termed the
    collection of all products and image views open in the Sentinel Toolbox, including any layers added to a view. When a session
    file is opened, a previously saved session (see <a href="#saveSession">Save Session</a>) is restored.
    Note that all open products will be closed before a session file is opened.
</p>

<h4>Reopen&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/icons/History24.gif"></h4>

<p>The Sentinel Toolbox stores the location of files previously opened or saved in this menu group. Select
    an entry and the Toolbox will re-open the product.</p>

<h4>OPeNDAP Access&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/icons/RsProduct24.gif"></h4>

<p>An <a href="../opendapclient/Overview.html">OPeNDAP client</a> for accessing a OPeNDAP server is shown a new dialogue. The provided
    data products of the server can be downloaded to the hard disk and opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.</p>

<h4>Product Grabber&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/icons/RsProduct24.gif"></h4>

    context menu when you right-click over the open product list.</p>

    (see <a href="#saveSession">Save Session</a>) explicitly.</p>
