<h3>Definition of Terms</h3>

<table>

    <tr><td>(Data) Product</td>
        <td>An object that contains remote sensing data for a well known scene on the earth.
            Within BEAM, a product can contain meta-data, geo-coding information, tie-point grids and bands.
            All band raster datasets within a product have the same pixel resolution and share the same
            geo-coding.
        </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Band</td>
        <td>A spectral or geophysical raster dataset of a product. The band's sample values are usually the
            measurements of a sensor.
        </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Tie-point grid</td>
        <td>An auxiliary (geophysical) raster dataset of a product. Tie-point grids usually provide less sample values
            than a band. Missing values, with respect to the full pixel resolution of a product, are obtained by a
            linear interpolation. The tie-point grid data does normally not originate from the sensor which provided
            the product's measurement data.
        </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Geometry</td>
        <td>A geometric shape (point, line, polyline or polygon). Geometries can be drawn on a scene view.
        </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Mask</td>
        <td>Marks a regions of raster dataset. Masks can be derived from an expressions, a value range or a geometry. 
        </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Flag-Dataset</td>
        <td>A special band type which contains quality flag information. Flag datasets
            always have an unsigned integer data type (8 to 32 bit). Each bit in a sample
            corresponds to a special flag value. Each flag's metadata is stored in a
            corresponding flag coding object. </td>
    </tr>

    <tr><td>Flag-Coding</td>
        <td>Flag codings are used to specify the bit positions of single flags within a integer sample value
            of a quality flags dataset. Each element in a flag coding provides the metadata for a flag such as
            the name, description and a bit-index.
        </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Index-Coding</td>
        <td>Index codings are used for classification bands. It maps a sample value of the band to a class by using the value as index.
            Each element in an index coding provides the metadata for a class such as the name, description and the index.
        </td></tr>


    <tr><td>Geo-Coding</td>
        <td>Provides the geodetic co-ordinates for a given pixel of a product.
            An image is geo-coded if it is somehow possible to find the geographical latitude and longitude values for
            any pixel.
            ENVISAT products store their geo-coding information in the tie-point grids
            named <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitue</code>. If a product has been map transformed,
            it is known to be geo-referenced and as such, tie-point information is no longer required.
        </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Geo-Reference</td>
        <td>An image is geo-referenced, if any point in the image can be found in a corresponding reference
            map by a linear transformation. Every pixel in the image has the same size if expressed in map units.
            Geo-referencing a
            geo-coded image includes image warping, applying a well known map projection and pixel re-sampling.
        </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Map</td>
        <td>Graphic representation of the physical features (natural, artificial, or both) of a part or the whole of the
            Earth's surface, by means of signs and symbols or photographic imagery, at an established scale, on a
            specified
            projection, and with the means of orientation indicated.
        </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Map Projection</td>
        <td>Orderly system of lines on a plane representing a corresponding system of
            imaginary lines on an adopted terrestrial or celestial datum surface. Also,
            the mathematical concept for such a system. For maps of the Earth, a projection
            consists of a graticule of lines representing parallels of latitude and
            meridians of longitude or a grid. </td>
    </tr>

    <tr><td>Graticule</td>
        <td>Network of parallels and meridians on a map or chart. A geographic graticule is a system of coordinates of
            latitude and longitude used to define the position of a point on the surface of the Earth with respect to
            the
            reference ellipsoid.
        </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Grid</td>
        <td>In connection with maps: a network of uniformly spaced parallel lines intersecting at right angles.
            When superimposed on a map, it usually carries the name of the projection used for the map that is,
            Lambert grid,
            transverse Mercator grid, universal transverse Mercator grid.
        </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Pixel coordinates</td>
        <td>In the BEAM software, pixel values always refer to the upper
            left corner of the pixel. Pixel co-ordinates are always zero based, the pixel at <code>X=0,Y=0</code> refers
            to the upper left
            pixel of an image and the upper left corner of that pixel.
        </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Pixel value</td>
        <td>In general a composite of red, green and blue <i>sample values</i> resulting in a colour as part of an
            image.
            Within the BEAM software, often synonymously referred to as the single, geophysical sample value of a band
            or tie-point grid.
        </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Geodetic co-ordinates</td>
        <td>Geodetic co-ordinates are given as latitude and longitude values and always refer -
            if not otherwise stated - to the WGS-84 ellipsoid.
            The geodetic co-ordinates of a pixel, always refer to the upper left corner of the pixel.
        </td></tr>
