<h3>BEAM Version 4.10</h3>

<p>Besides many bug fixes, these are the most important features and enhancements introduced in BEAM 4.10:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Enhanced support for vector data import (such as MERMAID Extraction files,
        see <a href="../visat/ImportMermaid.html">here</a>)</li>
    <li>Image views may be synchronised via geographical center coordinates (see <a href="../visat/NavigationWindow.html">here</a>)</li>
    <li>Completely revised profile plot; added support for correlative data (see <a href="../visat/ProfilePlotDialog.html">here</a>)</li>
    <li>Completely revised histogram; added support for logarithmic histogram and logiarithmic x-axis (see <a href="../visat/HistogramDialog.html">here</a>)</li>
    <li>Completely revised look and feel of scatter plot (see <a href="../visat/DensityPlotDialog.html">here</a>)</li>
    <li>Completely revised look and feel of statistics toolview (see <a href="../visat/StatisticsDialog.html">here</a>)</li>
    <li>Created completely new correlative plot (see <a href="../visat/CorrelativePlotDialog.html">here</a>)</li>
    <li>Added support for import of correlative data, such as <a href="../visat/ImportSeaDASTrack.html">SeaDAS-6.x ship tracks</a>, <a href="../visat/ImportCSV.html">generic CSV</a> or <a href="../visat/ImportMermaid.html">MERMAID data</a></li>
    <li>Added support for logarithmic x-axis in colour manipulation tool view (see <a href="../visat/ColorManipulationWindow.html">here</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h5>BEAM Version 4.9</h5>

<p>The most important features and enhancements introduced in BEAM 4.9 are summarized here:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Product files can now be dragged from the file explorer into the products view.</li>
    <li>Introduced a new operator for MERIS named 'Radiometry Correction'. It combines a
        SMILE correction, an equalisation, a radiance-to-reflectance conversion and a new
        radiometric re-calibration.
    </li>
    <li>A new tool for exporting pixels from a bunch of data products has been introduced.</li>
    <li>Subsets can now be created by specifying geo-coordinates.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h5>BEAM 4.8</h5>
<ul>
    <li><b>Readers</b> for <a href="../visat/ImportSpotVgt.html">SPOT VEGETATION</a> products,
        <a href="../visat/ImportLandsatTM.html">Landsat TM</a> products in GeoTIFF format,
        <a href="../visat/ImportNetCDF.html">gridded HDF-EOS</a> products, and generic <a
                href="../visat/ImportNetCDF.html">NetCDF/CF</a>-products have been added..
    </li>
    <li>
        A <b>writer</b> for generic <a href="../visat/ExportNetCdfProduct.html">NetCDF/CF</a>-products has been added.
    </li>
    <li>
        The possibility to apply <b>auto-grouping</b> in the product tree has benn added; that is, product
        nodes whose names begin equally are automatically put into a common group.
    </li>
    <li>
        A <a href="../visat/Toolbars.html">toolbar button</a> has been added to <b>show a world map overlay</b>
        on geographic lat/lon projected products.
    </li>
    <li>
        The ESA GlobCover Land Cover Map is used as default world map layer now; however, it is still possible to choose
        the
        NASA Blue Marble as world map layer instead.
    </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h5>BEAM 4.7</h5>
<ul>
    <li>VISAT now provides a <a href="../visat/VectorDataManagement.html">Vector Data Management</a> allowing users
        to <b>draw and manipulate geometries</b> (vector data) or to import them from <b>ESRI Shapefiles</b>.
        Geometries are now an integral part of the BEAM data model.
    </li>
    <li>The VISAT <a href="../visat/MaskManagement.html">Mask and ROI Management</a> has been revised completely.
        Any number of raster data masks can be defined by <b>band maths expressions</b>, <b>value ranges</b> and
        <b>existing geometries</b>. Each mask can serve as a <b>region of interest (ROI)</b> for raster data analysis.
    </li>
    <li>The <a href="../visat/StatisticsDialog.html">Statistics</a>, <a
            href="../visat/HistogramDialog.html">Histogram</a>,
        and <a href="../visat/DensityPlotDialog.html">Scatter Plot</a> tool windows have been enhanced in order to <b>support
            the
            new, named ROIs</b>.
        The <a href="../visat/StatisticsDialog.html">Statistics</a> tool window can now operate on <b>multiple ROIs</b>.
    </li>
    <li>The
        <a href="../visat/Reprojection.html">Reprojection</a> (formerly 'Map Projection'),
        <a href="../visat/Mosaic.html">Mosaicing</a> and
        <a href="../visat/Orthorectification.html">Orthorectification</a> processors have been redesigned from scratch.
        Due to the great <a href="http://www.geotools.org/">GeoTools</a> library, BEAM now offers more than
        <b>100 predefined, map projections</b> based on their <a href="http://www.epsg.org/">EPSG</a>
        codes. For user-defined map projections you can now select from 25 map projection
        transformations and more than 100 geodetic datums. Since the new Reprojection, Mosaicing and
        Orthorectification processors are developed using the <b>BEAM Graph Processing Framework</b> (GPF), they now
        offer a <b>powerful command-line</b> and can be used in any GPF XML <b>processing graph</b> for, e.g., pre-
        and post-processing.
        Finally, the <b>runtime performance</b> of this tools has been drastically improved.
    </li>
    <li>The <a href="../visat/NavigationWindow.html">Navigation</a> tool window has been improved. It is now feasible
        to display a <b>synchronized pixel cursor</b> in all image views.
    </li>
    <li>The <a href="../visat/WorldMap.html">World Map</a> tool window has been completely revised. It now uses a
        <b>higher-resolution RGB</b> (NASA Blue Marble) in which you can easily pan and zoom in and out.
    </li>
</ul>
