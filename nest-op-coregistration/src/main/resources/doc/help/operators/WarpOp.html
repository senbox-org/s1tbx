<h3>Warp Operator</h3>
<br>
The Warp operator is a component of <a href="../tutorials/coregistering_products.html">coregistration</a>. This operator computes a warp function from the master-slave ground control point (GCP) pairs produced
by <a href="GCPSelectionOp.html">GCP Selection operator</a>, and generates the final co-registered image. <br><h4>Compute Warp Polynomial</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once the valid master-slave GCP pairs are&nbsp;known, a polynomial of a
certain order is computed using a least square method, which
maps&nbsp;the master GCPs&nbsp;onto the slave GCPs. This function is
known as the warp function and is used to perform the co-registration.
Generally the warp function computed with the initial master-slave GCPs
is&nbsp;not the final warp function used in co-registration because it
normally introduces large errors for GCPs. These GCPs must be removed.
Therefore the warp function is
determined in an iterative manner.<br>
<ol>
<li>First&nbsp;a warp function is computed using the initial master-slave GCP pairs.</li>
<li>Then&nbsp;the master GCPs are mapped to the slave image with the&nbsp;warp function,
and&nbsp;the residuals between the mapped master GCPs and&nbsp;their corresponding slave GCPs are computed. The root
mean square&nbsp;(RMS) and the standard deviation for the residuals are also computed.</li>
<li>Next,&nbsp;the master-slave GCP pairs are filtered with the mean
RMS. GCP pairs with RMS greater than the mean RMS&nbsp;are eliminated.</li><li>The
same procedure (step 1 to 3) is repeated up to 2 times if needed and
each time&nbsp;the remaining master-slave GCP pairs from previous
elimination are used.</li>
<li>Finally&nbsp;the master-slave GCP pairs are filtered with the user
selected RMS threshold and the final warp function is computed with the
remaining master-slave GCP pairs.</li></ol>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The WARP polynomial order is specified by user in the dialog box.<br><ul><li>The valid values for the&nbsp;polynomial order are
1, 2 and 3.</li><li>For most cases where the input images do not suffer from a high level of
distortion, linear&nbsp;warp is generally enough and is recommended as&nbsp;default.</li><li>Higher order warp should be used only&nbsp;when image suffers from a high level distortion and a very good co-registration
accuracy is required.</li><li>Higher order&nbsp;warp requires more GCPs and can introduce large distortions
in image regions containing only a few GCPs.</li></ul>
<h4>Generate Co-Registered Image</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the
determination of&nbsp;warp function which maps&nbsp;pixels in the master
image to the slave image, the co-registered image can be obtained with
interpolation. Currently the following interpolation methods are
supported:<br>
<ol>
<li>Nearest-neighbour interpolation</li>
<li>Bilinear interpolation</li>
<li>Bicubic interpolation</li>
<li>Cubic interpolation (4 and 6 points)</li>
<li>Truncated sinc interpolation (6, 8 and 16 points)</li>

</ol><h4>Interpolation for InSAR</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For interferometric applications Cubic or Truncated sinc kernels are recommended.
These kernels assure the optimal interpolation in terms of Signal-to-Noise ratio.  

<h4>Residual File</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residual file is a
text file containing information about master and slave GCPs before and
after each elimination. The residual for a GCP pair is&nbsp;the errors
introduced by the warping function and can be used as a good indicator
of the quality of the warp function. It is often very useful to check
the information contained within the&nbsp;residual file to see if the
co-registration process can be considered to have been successful. For
example, the "RMS mean" value&nbsp;can be used as an approximate figure
of merit for the co-registration. User can view the residual file by
checkmarking the "Show Residuals" box in the dialog box. Detailed
information contained in the residual file are listed below:<br><ul><li>Band name</li><li>Warp coefficients</li><li>Master GCP coordinates</li><li>Slave GCP coordinates</li><li>Row and column residuals</li><li>Root
mean square errors (RMS)</li><li>Row&nbsp;residual mean</li><li>Row residual standard deviation</li><li>Column residual mean</li><li>Column residual standard deviation</li><li>RMS mean</li><li>RMS&nbsp;standard deviation</li></ul>
<h4>Parameters Used</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following parameters are used by the operator:<br>
<ol>
<li>RMS Threshold: The criterion for eliminating invalid GCPs. In general, the
smaller the threshold, the better the GCP quality, but lower the number of GCPs.</li>
<li>Warp Polynomial Order: The degree of the warp polynomial.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Interpolation Method: The interpolation method used computing co-registered slave image
pixel value.</li>
<li>Show Residuals: Display GCP residual file if selected.</li>
