# which generates tile usage reports from template files (Velocity template files, *.vm).
# Please have a look at the example template file '${beam-home}/conf/tile-usage-report.xhtml.vm'.
# It would generate an HTML report named 'tile-usage-report.xhtml' if the template file would be
# placed in the current working directory. The second is

# a log entry once a tile has been computed or (even more important) re-computed.

# Controls the tile size that is used for the images created when reading raster data from product files.

# Controls whether a PixelGeoCoding is attached to MERIS FRG/FSG products (e.g. created with AMORGOS),
# if an Envisat (N1) data file is opened.
# The default value is 'false', meaning that a Tie-point geo-coding is used instead.
# snap.envisat.usePixelGeoCoding = true

# Controls whether the latitude and longitude data for PixelGeoCoding is read into memory completely
# or only tile by tile when required. The default value is 'true'. Setting this value to 'false' will increase
# the memory required.

# When a NetCDF data file is opened, the values of one-dimensional variables that
# cannot be interpreted as images by SNAP are interpreted as metadata. This can
# cause memory issues, which can be avoided by setting this property to a number >= 0.
