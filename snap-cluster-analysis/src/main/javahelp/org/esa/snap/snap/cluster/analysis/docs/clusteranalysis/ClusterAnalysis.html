<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
    <strong>Cluster analysis</strong> (or <strong>clustering</strong>) is the classification of objects into different
    groups, or more precisely, the partitioning of a data set into subsets (<strong>clusters</strong> or
    <strong>classes</strong>), so that the data in each subset
    (ideally) share some common trait - often proximity according to some defined distance measure. Data clustering is a
    common
    technique for statistical data analysis, which is used in many fields, including machine learning, data mining,
    pattern recognition, image analysis and bioinformatics. The computational task of classifying the data set into
    <em>k</em> clusters is often referred to as <em>k</em>-clustering.
</p>

<h5>Types of clustering</h5>

<p>
    Data clustering algorithms can be hierarchical. Hierarchical algorithms find successive clusters using previously
    established clusters. Hierarchical algorithms can be agglomerative or divisive. Agglomerative algorithms begin with
    each element as a separate cluster and merge them into successively larger
    clusters. Divisive algorithms begin with the whole set and proceed to divide it into successively smaller clusters.
    <strong>Partitional</strong> algorithms typically determine all clusters at once, but can also be used as divisive
    algorithms in the hierarchical clustering.
</p>

<h5>Distance measures</h5>

<p>
    An important step in any clustering is to select a distance measure, which will determine how the similarity of two
    elements is calculated. This will influence the shape of the clusters, as some elements may be close to one another
    according to one distance and further away according to another.
</p>

<p>
    Particularly important distance measures are the <strong>Euclidean distance</strong> which leads to a spherical
    shape of the
    clusters, and the <strong>Mahalanobis distance</strong>, which leads to arbitrary elliptic shapes, reflecting
    the different scales and correlations in the data.

<h3>SNAP cluster analysis tools</h3>

SNAP currently offers two clustering tools, both employing partional algorithms:

<dl>
    <dt><a href="KMeans.html">K-means clustering</a></dt>
    <dd>
        This algorithm assigns each pixel to the cluster whose center is nearest. The center is the arithmetic mean of
        all pixels belonging to the cluster. The main advantages of this algorithm are its simplicity and speed, which
        allows it to run on large datasets. Its disadvantage is that it does not take into account different scales and
        correlations in the data. It minimizes intra-cluster variance, but does not ensure that the result has a global
        minimum of variance. This algorithm should be your primary choice for performing a cluster analysis. <em>For
        the analysis of large scenes, this algorithm is strongly recommended.</em>
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="EM.html">EM clustering</a></dt>
    <dd>
        This algorithm is a generalization of the <a href="KMeans.html">k-means</a> algorithm where the clusters are
        ellipsoids defined by a center and a covariance matrix. The main advantage of this algorithm is that it is not
        affected by different scales of the data dimensions and correlations between them. Its disadvantage is
        considerably less speed, which practically limits the applicability to smaller datasets only. It minimizes the
        intra-cluster variances but does not ensure that the result has a global minimum of variance. Use this algorithm
        when you want to perform a cluster analysis of a small scene or region-of-interest and are not satisfied with the
        results obtained from the <a href="KMeans.html">k-means</a> algorithm.
