<p>The main interface of this package is the {@link <code>Tool</code>} interface.
It represents a graphical tool with which a user can select, move, manipulate or draw figures
on a drawing surface of the type {@link <code>org.esa.beam.framework.ui.ImageDisplay</code>}.

<p>The {@link <code>Tool</code>} interface in conjunction with the
{@link <code>org.esa.beam.framework.ui.ImageDisplay</code>} class implements the GoF 'State' pattern:
An image display can have a tool assigned to which it delegates all user inputs. The tool itself
can change at any time. Neew tools can be developed without changing the <code>ImageDisplay</code>
implementation.
