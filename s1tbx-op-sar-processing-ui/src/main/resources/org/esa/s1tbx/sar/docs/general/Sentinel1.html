<h2>SENTINEL-1 Mission</h2>
<p>The Sentinel-1 mission is the European Radar Observatory for
    the Copernicus joint initiative of the European Commission (EC) and the
    European Space Agency (ESA). The mission is composed of a constellation of two
    satellites, Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B, sharing the same orbital plane with a
    180° orbital phasing difference. The mission provides an independent
    operational capability for continuous radar mapping of the Earth with enhanced
    revisit frequency, coverage, timeliness and reliability for operational
    services and applications requiring long time series.</p>

<p>Sentinel-1 carries a single C-band synthetic aperture radar
    instrument operating at a centre frequency of 5.405 GHz. It includes an active
    phased array antenna providing fast scanning in elevation and azimuth. The
    C-SAR instrument supports operation in dual polarisation (HH+HV, VV+VH)
    implemented through one transmit chain (switchable to H or V) and two parallel
    receive chains for H and V polarisation.</p>

<p>A single Sentinel-1 satellite is able to map the entire
    world once every 12 days. The two-satellite constellation offers a six day
    exact repeat cycle. The constellation will have a repeat frequency
    (ascending/descending) of 3 days at the equator, less than 1 day at the Arctic
    and is expected to provide coverage over Europe, Canada and main shipping
    routes in 1-3 days, regardless of weather conditions. </p>

<h2>Modes</h2>
<h4>Stripmap Mode</h4>

<p>Stripmap (SM) imaging mode is provided for continuity with
    ERS and ENVISAT missions. Stripmap provides coverage with a 5 m by 5 m
    resolution over a narrow swath width of 80 km. </p>

<p>The ground swath is illuminated by a continuous sequence of
    pulses while the antenna beam is pointing to a fixed azimuth angle and an
    approximately fixed off-nadir angle. SM images have continuous along track
    image quality at an approximately constant incidence angle. The incidence angle
    is the angle between the incident SAR beam and the axis perpendicular to the
    local geodetic ground surface. One of six imaging swaths can be selected by
    changing the beam incidence angle and the elevation beamwidth.</p>

<h4>Interferometric Wide Swath Mode</h4>

<p>The Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode is the main
    acquisition mode over land and satisfies the majority of service requirements.
    It acquires data with a 250 km swath at 5 m by 20 m spatial resolution (single
    look). IW mode captures three sub-swaths using Terrain Observation with
    Progressive Scans SAR (TOPSAR). With the TOPSAR technique, in addition to
    steering the beam in range as in ScanSAR, the beam is also electronically
    steered from backward to forward in the azimuth direction for each burst,
    avoiding scalloping and resulting in homogeneous image quality throughout the
    swath [R11].</p>

<p>TOPSAR mode is intended to replace the conventional ScanSAR
    mode, achieving the same coverage and resolution as ScanSAR, but with a nearly
    uniform SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and DTAR (Distributed Target Ambiguity
    Ratio).</p>

<p>Azimuth resolution is reduced compared to SM due to the
    shorter target illumination time of the burst. Using the sweeping azimuth
    pattern, each target is seen under the same antenna pattern, independently from
    its azimuth position in the burst image. By shrinking the azimuth antenna
    pattern, as seen by a target on the ground, scalloping effects on the image can
    be reduced. Bursts are synchronised from pass to pass to ensure the alignment
    of interferometric pairs.</p>

<p>IW SLC products contain one image per sub-swath and one per
    polarisation channel, for a total of three (single polarisation) or six (dual
    polarisation) images in an IW product.</p>

<p>Each sub-swath image consists of a series of bursts, where
    each burst has been processed as a separate SLC image. The individually focused
    complex burst images are included, in azimuth-time order, into a single
    sub-swath image with black-fill demarcation in between, similar to ENVISAT ASAR
    Wide ScanSAR SLC products.</p>

<p>Due to the one natural azimuth look inherent in the data,
    the imaged ground area of adjacent bursts will only marginally overlap in
    azimuth by just enough to provide contiguous coverage of the ground. The images
    for all bursts in all sub-swaths are resampled to a common pixel spacing grid
    in range and azimuth while preserving the phase information.</p>

<h4>Extra Wide Swath Mode</h4>

<p>The Extra Wide (EW) swath imaging mode is intended for
    maritime, ice and polar zone operational services where wide coverage and short
    revisit times are demanded. The EW mode works similarly to the IW mode
    employing a TOPSAR technique using five sub-swaths instead of three, resulting
    in a lower resolution (20 m&nbsp;by 40 m). </p>

<p>EW SLC products contain one image per sub-swath and one per
    polarisation channel, for a total of five (single polarisation) or 10 (dual
    polarisation) images in an EW product. Like IW, EW mode can also be used for interferometry since it shares the
    same characteristics for burst synchronisation, baseline and Doppler stability.</p>

<h4>Wave Mode</h4>

<p>SENTINEL-1 Wave mode in conjunction with global ocean wave
    models, can help determine the direction, wavelength and heights of waves on
    the open oceans.</p>

<p>SENTINEL-1 Wave mode is similar to ERS and ENVISAT wave mode
    imaging but with improved resolution, larger vignettes and a new 'leap frog'
    acquisition pattern. WV acquisitions consist of several vignettes exclusively
    in either VV or HH polarisation, with each vignette processed as a separate
    image. WV mode products can contain any number of vignettes, potentially
    amounting to an entire data-take. Each vignette will be contained in an
    independent image within the product.</p>

<p>Wave mode acquires data in 20 km by 20 km vignettes, at 5 m
    by 5 m spatial resolution, every 100 km along the orbit, acquired alternately
    on two different incidence angles. Vignettes on the same incidence angle are
    separated by 200 km. Swaths alternate incidence angles between near range and
    far range (23° and 36.5° respectively).</p>


<p>The Wave mode at VV polarisation is the default mode for
    acquiring data over open ocean. WV mode is acquired at the same bit rate as SM
    however, due to the small vignettes, single polarisation and sensing at 100 km
    intervals, the data volume is much lower.</p>
<h2>Products</h2>
<p>SENTINEL data products are made available systematically and
    free of charge to all data users including the general public, scientific and
    commercial users. Radar data will be delivered within an hour of reception for
    Near Real-Time (NRT) emergency response, within three hours for NRT priority
    areas and within 24 hours for systematically archived data.</p>

<p>All data products are distributed in the SENTINEL Standard
    Archive Format for Europe (SAFE) format.</p>

<p>Each mode can potentially produce products at SAR Level-0,
    Level-1 SLC, Level-1 GRD, and Level-2 OCN.</p>

<p>Data products are available in single polarisation (VV or
    HH) for Wave mode and dual polarisation (VV+VH or HH+HV) and single polarisation
    (HH or VV) for SM, IW and EW modes.</p>

<h4>Level-0</h4>

<p>The SAR Level-0 products consist of the sequence of Flexible Dynamic Block Adaptive Quantization (FDBAQ)
    compressed unfocused SAR raw data. For the data to be usable, it will need to be decompressed and processed
    using focusing software.</p>

<p>Level-0 data includes noise, internal calibration and echo source packets as well as orbit and attitude
    information.</p>

<h4>Level-1</h4>

<p>Level-1 data is the generally available products intended
    for most data users. Level-1 products are produced as Single Look Complex (SLC)
    and Ground Range Detected (GRD).</p>

<h5>Level-1 Single Look Complex</h5>

<p>Level-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) products consist of
    focused SAR data geo-referenced using orbit and attitude data from the
    satellite and provided in zero-Doppler slant-range geometry. The products
    include a single look in each dimension using the full TX signal bandwidth and
    consist of complex samples preserving the phase information.</p>

<p>The products include a single look in each dimension using
    the full available signal bandwidth and complex samples (real and imaginary)
    preserving the phase information. The products have been geo-referenced using
    the orbit and attitude data from the satellite and have been corrected for
    azimuth bi-static delay, elevation antenna pattern and range spreading loss.</p>

<p>Stripmap SLCs contain one image for its single swath per
    polarisation band. IW, having three swaths, has three images in single
    polarisation and six images for dual polarisation. EW, having five swaths, has
    five images for single polarisation and ten images for dual polarisation.</p>

<p>For IW and EW, each sub-swath consists of a series of
    bursts. Each burst has been processed as a separate SLC image. The individually
    focused complex burst images are included, in azimuth-time order, into a single
    sub-swath image, with black-fill demarcation in between, similar to the ENVISAT
    ASAR Wide ScanSAR SLC products.</p>

<p>For IW, a focused burst has a duration of ~2.75 seconds and
    a burst overlap of approximately ~0.4 seconds. For EW, a focused burst has a
    duration of ~3.19 seconds with an overlap of ~0.1 seconds. The overlap slightly
    increases in range within a sub-swath. Unlike ASAR WSS which contains a large
    overlap between beams, for SENTINEL-1 TOPSAR products, the imaged ground area
    of adjacent bursts only marginally overlap in azimuth just enough to provide
    contiguous coverage of the ground. This is due to the one natural azimuth look
    inherent in the data.</p>

<p>Images for all bursts in all sub-swaths of an IW SLC product
    are re-sampled to a common pixel spacing grid in range and azimuth. Burst
    synchronisation is ensured for both IW and EW products.</p>

<p>The Swath Timing data set record in SLC products contains
    information about the bursts including dimensions, timing and location that can
    be used to merge the bursts and swaths together.</p>


<h5>Level-1 Ground Range Detected</h5>

<p>Level-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) products consist of
    focused SAR data that has been detected, multi-looked and projected to ground
    range using an Earth ellipsoid model. </p>

<p>The ellipsoid projection of the GRD products is corrected
    using the terrain height specified in the product general annotation. The
    terrain height used varies in azimuth but is constant in range.</p>

<p>Ground range coordinates are the slant range coordinates
    projected onto the ellipsoid of the Earth. Pixel values represent detected
    magnitude. Phase information is lost. The resulting product has approximately
    square resolution pixels and square pixel spacing with reduced speckle at a
    cost of reduced geometric resolution.</p>

<p>In addition to the corrections applied to Level-1 SLC
    products, GRD products have thermal noise removed to improve the quality of the
    detected image.</p>

<p>For the IW and EW GRD products, multi-looking is performed
    on each burst individually. All bursts in all sub-swaths are then seamlessly
    merged to form a single, contiguous, ground range, detected image per
    polarisation channel.<br>
    GRD products can be in one of three resolutions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Full Resolution (FR)</li>
    <li>High Resolution (HR)</li>
    <li>Medium Resolution (MR)</li>
</ul>


<p>The resolution is dependent upon the amount of multi-looking
    performed. Level-1 GRD products come in MR and HR for IW and EW modes, MR for
    WV mode and MR, HR and FR for SM mode.</p>

<h4>Level-2</h4>

<p>Level-2 Ocean (OCN) products include components for Ocean Swell spectra (OSW) providing continuity with
    ERS and ASAR WV and two new components, Ocean Wind Fields (OWI) and Surface Radial Velocities (RVL).
</p>

<p>The OSW is a two-dimensional ocean surface swell spectrum
    and also includes an estimate of the wind speed and direction per swell
    spectrum. The OSW is generated from Stripmap and Wave modes only. For Stripmap
    mode, there are multiple spectra derived from internally generated Level-1 SLC
    image. For Wave mode, there is one spectrum per vignette.</p>

<p>The OWI is a ground range gridded estimate of the surface
    wind speed and direction at 10 m above the surface derived from internally
    generated Level-1 GRD images of SM, IW or EW modes.</p>

<p>The RVL is a ground range gridded difference between the
    measured Level-2 Doppler grid and the Level-1 calculated geometrical Doppler.</p>
