<h3>Band-Pass Filter Operator</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">This operator applies a band-pass filter (in range) to an SLC such that the result has 1/3 the original bandwidth.
Note that the output SLC is basebanded. The center frequency- and bandwidth-related product metadata is updated accordingly, so that subsequent
interferometric operations can work as expected.

<h4>Input<br>
</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    The input to this operator should be an SLC product with the respective I/Q bands.
<br>

<h4>Output<br>
</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    The output of this operator is a product with the same bands as those of the input product but with bandpassed
    filtered and basebanded (in range) I/Q bands.
<br>

<h4>Parameters<br>
</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<ul>
    <li>
        subband: assume BW represents the bandwidth of the input SLC.
        Then, "low" corresponds to a subband with a center frequency of <b>-BW/3</b>, and
        "high" corresponds to a subband with a center frequency of <b>BW/3</b>. The output
        subband will have a bandwidth of <b>BW/3</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        alpha: alpha coefficient to define the spectral Hamming window for weighting the subband.
    </li>
</ul>
