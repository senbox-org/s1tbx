<h3>Reprojection Operator</h3>
<p> The Map Projection Operator applies a selected&nbsp;Map Projection
to the input product and creates a new transposed output
product.&nbsp;</p><p>
</p><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 545px; height: 541px;" alt="" src="images/ReprojectionProjectionParameters.png"><br></div><br><br><p>The following
parameters are used by the Operator:
</p>
<h5>Coordinate Reference System (CRS)</h5>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Custom CRS:</b>
                The transformation used by the projection can be selected. Also the geodetic datum and
                transformation parameters can be set, if possible for the selected transformation.
            </p>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Predefined CRS:</b>
                By clicking on the <b>Select...</b> button a new dialog is shown
                where a
                predefined
                CRS can be selected.
            </p>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Use CRS of:</b>
                A product can be selected to use its projected Coordinate Reference System. This will have the effect
                that source
                product will cover the same geographic region on the same CRS. Which means that both products are
                collocated.
            </p>

            <h5>Output Settings</h5>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Preserve resolution:</b>
                If unchecked the <b>Output Parameters...</b> is enabled and the upcoming
                dialog lets you edit the output parameters like
                easting and northing of the reference pixel, the pixel size and the scene height and width.
            </p>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Reproject tie-point grids:</b>
                Specifies whether or not the tie-point grids shall be included. If they are reprojected they will appear
                as bands in
                the target product and not any more as tie-point grids.
            </p>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>No-data value:</b>
                The default no-data value is used for output pixels in the projected band which have either no
                corresponding pixel
                in the source product or the source pixel is invalid.
            </p>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Resampling Method:</b>
                You can select one resampling method for the projection.
                For a brief description have a look at Resampling
                Methods.
            </p>

            <h5>Output Information</h5>

            <p class="i1">
                Displays some information about the output, like scene width and height, the geographic coordinate of
                the scene center and short description of the selected CRS.<br>
                When clicking the <b>Show WKT...</b> button the corresponding Well-Known Text of the currently defined
                CRS is shown.
            </p>
