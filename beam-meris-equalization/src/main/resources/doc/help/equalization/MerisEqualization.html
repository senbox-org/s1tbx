<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
    The MERIS equalization module performs a radiometric equalization of the MERIS L1b products (RR, FR and FRS). It
    reduces detector-to-detector and camera-to-camera systematic radiometric differences and results into a diminution
    of the vertical stripping observed on MERIS L1b products.
</p>

<p class="inote">
    <b>Note: Processing MERIS FR and FRS data products</b><br>
    The Look-Up-Tables used by the equalization algorithm for MERIS FR and FRS data products are currently in a
    preliminary state. The LUTs are currently simply obtained by linear interpolation of the RR LUTs.
    This results in an equalization of the FR product only at a max RR spatial frequency and consequently, not all
    the FR detector-to-detector systematic variations are corrected for. A future version will include newly generated LUTs
    to allow equalization at maximum FR spatial frequency.
