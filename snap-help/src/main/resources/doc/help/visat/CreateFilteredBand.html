<h3>Create Filtered Band</h3>

<p>Filtered bands are created either by applying a filter operation to the underlying raster data of a given source
    band.
    The term <em>filtering</em> is used here in a narrow sense, meaning that a target pixel value is computed from the
    N x M pixel neighborhood of a corresponding source pixel.
    The Sentinel Toolbox supports basically two types of image filters, linear and non-linear filters:</p>

<p><strong>Linear filters (Convolution):</strong> A target pixel is computed by element-wise multiplication of the N x M source
    pixel neighborhood with a given N x M convolution kernel.</p>

<p><strong>Non-linear filters:</strong> A target pixel is computed by applying a non-linear function (such as min, max, or median)
    to all source pixels of a N x M neighborhood. The pixels within the N x M neighborhood may be selected by a N x M
    Boolean kernel mask, turning the operation into a <em>morphological filter</em>. In this case the (Boolean)
        kernel acts as the filter's <i>structuring element</i>.
</p>

<p>Image filters take full advantage of the no-data / valid-mask properties of a given source band.
    If the source pixel is a no-data pixel or if no-data pixels are encountered in its neighborhood,
    the target pixel will also become a no-data pixel (value will be NaN).</p>

<h4>Pre-defined Filters</h4>

<p>SNAP has the following pre-defined filters:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Detect Lines</strong>: Horizontal Edges, Vertical Edges, Diagonal Edges, Compass Edge Detector, Roberts Cross</li>
    <li><strong>Detect Gradients (Emboss)</strong>: Sobel</li>
    <li><strong>Smooth and Blurr</strong>: Arithmetic Mean, Low-Pass</li>
    <li><strong>Sharpen</strong>: High-Pass</li>
    <li><strong>Enhance Discontinuities</strong>: Laplace</li>
    <li><strong>Non-Linear Filters</strong>: Minimum, Maximum, Mean, Median, Standard Deviation</li>
    <li><strong>Morphological Filters</strong>: Erosion, Dilation, Opening, Closing</li>
</ul>

<h4>User-defined Filters</h4>

<p>Users can define their own linear, non-linear, or morphological filters.</p>
