<h3>Sentinel-1 Enhanced Spectral Diversity<br>
</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>This operator follows the S-1 Back Geocoding
operator in the TOPS InSAR processing chain. It first estimates a
constant range offset for the whole sub-swath of the split S-1 SLC
image using incoherent cross-correlation. The estimation is done for
each burst using a small block of data in the center of the burst. The
estimates from all bursts are then averaged to get the final constant
range offset for the whole&nbsp;</span><span>sub-swath</span><span>.<br>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The operator then estimates a constant
azimuth offset for the whole sub-swath using the Enhanced Spectral
Diversity (ESD) method. The ESD
approach exploits the data at the overlapped area of the adjacent
bursts. The estimation is done for a number of windows in every overlapped area and the final
azimuth offset is obtained by averaging all the estimations. <br>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The estimated range and azimuth shifts are
saved in both the metadata of the output product and in an ASCII file
with master acquisition date and "_azimuth_shift" in the file name. The
file can be found at user's \.snap\var\log folder. <br>
</span>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Finally, the operator performs range and
azimuth corrections for every burst using the range and azimuth offsets
estimated above with a phase
ramp method in the frequency domain</span>.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Users
can skip the range and azimuth shift estimations by providing their own
range and azimuth shifts in the UI. The shifts can be previously
estimated by running the S-1 Azimuth Shift Estimation operator with
data of current sub-swath or other sub-swath. </p><h4>Input <br>
</h4>



<ul>
<li>The input to this operator is the resulting product from the
S-1 Back Geocoding operator. It is the co-registered master and slave images
for the same
sub-swath and same polarization (e.g. IW1 -
VV). <br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Output <br>
</h4>




<ul>
<li>The output of the operator are the co-registered master and slave
bands in I/Q format with the range and azimuth shift corrections being performed to the slave bands. <br>

  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Parameters Used<br>
</h4>




<ul>
  <li>Registration Window Width: Width of the sub-set of image used
for cross-correlation. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Registration Window Height: Height of the sub-set of image used
for cross-correlation. Larger window generally implies accurate
estimation of the range shift and also means larger memory and longer
processing time.</li>
  <li>Search Window Accuracy in Azimuth Direction: The search accuracy
in azimuth direction for the maximum correlation. The search window
height is 2*Acc.</li>
  <li>Search
Window Accuracy in Range Direction: The search accuracy in range
direction for the maximum correlation. The search window width is
2*Acc. .</li>
  <li>Window Oversampling Factor: The oversampling factor for the
search window. The larger the factor, the better the achievable
accuracy, and the larger the computation cost.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Cross-Correlation Threshold: Threshold
for normalized cross-correlation value. If the cross-correlation value
is greater than the threshold, then the estimated range offset is
considered valid, otherwise invalid.</li>
  <li>Coherence
Threshold for Outlier Removal: Pixels with coherence higher than the
threshold are used for the azimuth shift estimation.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Number of Windows Per Overlap for ESD: The number of windows for azimuth offset estimation using ESD for each overlap area.</li>
  <li>Use user supplied shifts: If the checkbox is selected, then user
supplied azimuth and range shifts will be used in the correction.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The overall azimuth shift in pixels: The user provided azimuth shift in pixels. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The overall range shift in pixels: The user provided range shift in pixels. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
