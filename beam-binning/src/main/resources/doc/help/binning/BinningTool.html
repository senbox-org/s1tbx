<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The BEAM Level 3 Binning Processor is based on two different algorithms:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The NASA SeaWiFS binning algorithm as described in: <i>&quot;Level 3
            SeaWiFS Data Products: Spatial and Temporal Binning Algorithms&quot; J.W.Campbell,
            J.M. Blasidell, and M.Darzi , NASA Technical Memorandum 104566, Vol.32</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The flux-conserving resampling algorithm has been implemented by Thomas Lankester of Infoterra
            (<a href="http://www.infoterra-global.com">www.infoterra-global.com</a>). The algorithm uses the fast
            Sutherland-Hodgeman
            area clipping. For more information on the algorithm used refer to the Polygon Clipping Resampling page
            (<a href="http://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/polysamp/">http://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/polysamp/</a>).
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>An algorithmic description
    of the processor can be found <a href="BinningAlgorithmDescription.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally to the original
    algorithm, this implementation gives the user the ability to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Select one of three possible
        binning algorithms (Maximum Likelihood, Arithmetic Mean and Minimum/Maximum)</li>
    <li>Predefine a subset region
        as minimum/maximum latitude/longitude. All pixels outside this region are
        rejected.</li>
    <li>Define the bin size without
        restrictions. NOTE: When leaving the SeaWiFS predefined bin sizes, there is
        no guarantee that the equator lies in between two bins.</li>
    <li>Update long term means
        step by step as the input data becomes available.</li>
    <li>Binning and flux-conserving as independent resampling methods.</li>
    <li>Process multiple bands with different Bitmask expression
        and differen binning algorithms at the same time.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The term binning refers to the process of distributing the contributions of Level 2
    pixels in satellite coordinates to a fixed Level 3 grid using a geographic reference system.
    In most cases a sinusoidal projection is used to realize Level 3 grid comprising
    a fixed number of equal area bins with global coverage.
    This is for example true for the SeaWiFS Level 3 products.</p>

<p>
    As long as the area of an input pixel is small compared to the area of a bin,
    a simple binning is sufficient. In this case,
    the geodetic center coordinate of the Level 2 pixel is used
    to find the bin in the Level 3 grid whose area is intersected by this point.
    If the area of the contributing pixel is equal or even larger than the bin area,
    this simple binning will produce composites with insufficient accuracy and
    visual artefacts such as Moiré effects will dominate the resulting datasets.</p>

<p>
    The following figure illustrates this problem.</p>

<p><img src="images/chessGrid.png"></p>

<p><i>Level 2 grid (blue) and Level 3 grid (yellow)</i></p>

<p>The blue chessboard grid refers to the input data,
    the yellow one refers to the final Level 3 grid. As the figure clearly shows,
    single Level 2 pixels cannot be uniquely be assigned to single bins.</p>

<p>
    In this case the contributions of each Level 2 pixel has to be distributed
    over multiple overlapping bins in order to conserve the total contributions
    of Level 2 pixels. The contribution-conserving problem reduces to finding the
    set of Level 3 bins overlapped by each Level 2 pixel and then calculating the
    overlap areas. The total contribution in the bin is then the sum of contributions
    from the overlapped pixels.</p>

<p>
    In contrast to the SeaWiFS binning that operates on an equal area sinusoidal grid
    the flux-conserving resampling uses an equal area longitude-latitude grid.</p>

<h3>Tool breakdown</h3>

<p>Due to the complexity of
    the processing and to give the user a maximum flexibility, this scientific tool
    includes four specialized tools.</p>

<p><a href="BinningInitializeTool.html">L3
    Initial Processor</a></p>

<p><a href="BinningUpdateTool.html">L3
    Update Processor</a></p>

<p><a href="BinningFinalTool.html">L3
    Final Processor</a></p>

<h4>Data flow and processing
    flow</h4>
The following sketch shows
the complete data flow of the L3 processor when all processing stages are performed.
<p><img src="images/L3WholeProcess.jpg"></p>

<p>This complete set of operations,
    including all necessary cleanup operations, is performed by the L3 Processor.
    The specialized processors (Init, Update and Final) perform only a subset of
    the operations.</p>
<h4>L3 Initial Processor</h4>

<p>The L3 Initial processor
    merely creates the Temporal Bin Database and stores all processing parameters
    in the database.</p>

<p><img src="images/L3InitialProcessor.jpg"></p>
<h4>L3 Update Processor</h4>

<p>The L3 Update processor
    accumulates all input products assigned. It </p>
<ul>
    <li>creates the spatial bin
        database for each product, </li>
    <li>performs the spatial
        binning, </li>
    <li>updates the temporal
        bin database and finally </li>
    <li>deletes each spatial
        bin database again.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="images/L3UpdateProcessor.jpg"></p>
<h4>L3 Final Processor</h4>

<p>The L3 Final Processor creates
    the final L3 product. It performs the following steps: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Create the Final bin
        database for interpreted data values (when the algorithm requires this)</li>
    <li>Performs the bin interpretation
        (when the algorithm requires this)</li>
    <li>Performs the Map Projection
        and writes the final L3 Product</li>
    <li>Deletes the Final Bin
        Database</li>
    <li>optionally deletes the
        Temporal Bin Database.</li>
</ul>
