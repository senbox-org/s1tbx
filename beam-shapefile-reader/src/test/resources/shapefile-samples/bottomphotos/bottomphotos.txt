  Description:
    Abstract: This data set includes the locations and hotlinks to photographs of the seafloor in Boston Harbor and the harbor approaches, Massachusetts. The photos were taken using the mini-SEABOSS system during USGS survey 04019, conducted September 14-17, 2004.
    Purpose: These data were collected under a cooperative agreement with the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) and the U.S. Geological Survey, Coastal and Marine Geology Program, Woods Hole Science Center. Geophysical data associated with this project were collected by NOAA NOS. Ground-truth data were collected during a survey (September 14-17, 2004) on the USGS R/V Rafael.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Geographic location of each photograph was extracted from the survey vessel navigation string during post processing. MINI SeaBOSS sampler was lowered of Starboard side of survey vessel and lowered to seafloor. Vessel and sampler then drifted with wind and tide. Bottom Photograph location is recorded as survey vessel navigation which could differ by 2-5 meters depending on bottom currents, tide, and wind.
