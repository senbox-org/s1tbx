<h3>Estimation of Coregistration Polynomial (CPM) and Resampling</h3>

<p>
    Estimation of Coregistration Polynomial (CPM) and Resampling is an operator of an
    <a href="../tutorials/insar_coregistration.html"> interferometric coregistration processing chain.</a>
    This operator estimates the coregistration polynomial, and utilizes that polynomial in resampling of the slave
    image into the geometry of the master image.
</p>

<p><br>
    The estimation of the coregistration polynomial, a polynomial that models tha alignment of slave on master, is
    performed in the least-square sense. Then using this transformation model, the slave image is resampled. The
    resampling operation is implemented as the reconstruction of original signal from the input samples by correlation
    with interpolation kernels in the space domain. This estimation and resampling model is in accordance with sub-pixel
    accuracy demands.
</p>

<h4>Operator Parameters</h4>

<p>
    The following parameters are used by this operator:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Coregistration Polynomial Degree:</b> Degree of two-dimensional polynomial - degree 2 is advised.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Maximum number of iterations:</b> Number of iterations for the outliers removal. The outliers are removed
        automatically based on statistical tests (i.e., hypothesis testing). The least squares adjustment is repeated,
        until all statistical tests are accepted or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Significance Level for Outlier Removal:</b> Level of significance for the the outlier detection (i.e.,
        hypothesis
        testing). A higher value accepts more outliers. The listed values are so called alpha parameters, and are used
        in computation of the test critical values. For listed parameters these test critical values are pre-computed.
        In theory the critical levels are computed as a square distribution. For example, for the significance level
        of alpha = 0.05, the critical value is 1.96, for a half sided test.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Interpolation Method:</b> List of interpolation kernels. Available convolution kernels are: Linear, Cubic
        Convolution and Truncated Sinc. For interferometric applications Cubic or Truncated sinc kernels are
        recommended. These kernels assure the optimal interpolation in terms of Signal-to-Noise ratio.

    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Offset Refinement Based on DEM:</b> Optional refinement of the coregistration offsets based on the
        a-priori DEM. See Implementation notes for more implementation details. The level of coregistration improvement
        (i.e., measured by coherence) increases with the resolution of the input data, scales with the length of 
        baselines, and it is also dependent on the topography roughness.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Digital Elevation Model:</b> List of supported Digital-Elevation-Models (DEMs). Note that elevation
                data for given master/slave combination is downloaded and interpolated automatically. No user
                interaction is required.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

        <b>Show Residuals:</b> Display log file if selected.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Implementation Details</h4>

<h5>Estimation of Coregistration Polynomial</h5>

<p>
    Based on the estimated offsets computed in previous <i>Coarse and Fine Coregistration</i> step, a 2d-polynomial
    model of
    certain degree of the coregistration is computed. When the step DEM refinement is applied, the polynomial is
    estimated through the residuals between the Fine Coregistration and geometrical offsets computed using DEM.
</p>

<p>
    For computation of the polynomial a least squares solution is used, i.e., solution by Cholesky decomposition of the
    normal matrix. Note that data may be excluded a-priori by setting a threshold value for the correlation, in operator
    <i>Coarse and Fine Coregistration</i>.
</p>

<h5>Resampling</h5>

<p>Image interpolation is performed with a kernel function such as, e.g., a truncated sinc function. First a look-up
    table is pre-computed for the selected interpolation kernel. Interpolation is independent for azimuth and range
    direction. For all points in the overlap between master and slave, the co-registration polynomial is evaluated.</p>
</p>

<h5>DEM Based Refinement</h5>

<p>
    Depending on the geometry of interferometric pair and date resolution, the coregistration offsets estimated
    by the correlation optimization can be improved (refined) using a height information (via DEM). For pixel of the 
    master image the corresponding (real valued) coordinate in the slave image is computed. To perform this step 
    accurately a DEM is required, e.g., obtained by the SRTM mission. Note that this DEM based refinement is 
    not directly dependent on the correlation between the master and the slave image. Using DEM refinement prevents 
    coregistration errors due to bad window distribution or lack of useful correlation windows in the conventional 
    method. Moreover, the coregistration improves in case of large baselines and strong topography. This
    improvement becomes especially significant in case of X-band data.
