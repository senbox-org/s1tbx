<h3>Exporting data for SNAPHU processing</h3><h4>
    SNAPHU Data Export&nbsp;<br>

</h4>

<p>
    The main purpose of SNAPHU data export functionality is three-fold:
</p><ol>
    <li>
        To export data (bands) in the format compatible for SNAPHU processing,
    </li>
    <li>
        To build a SNAPHU configuration file (snaphu.conf), the file where processing parameters for SNAPHU are
        being stored,
    </li>
    <li>
        To construct a <i>container</i> product that will store metadata and bands to be used when SNAPHU results
        are being ingested back into the Toolbox.
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>
    External processing with SNAPHU
</h4>

<p>
    Given that the SNAPHU software is properly installed and configured, unwrapping of exported product is
    quite straightforward. In the directory where the SNAPHU product is being saved, the following command is to be
    executed:
</p>

<p><b><code>snaphu -f snaphu.conf YOUR_PHASE_BAND.img 99999</code></b></p>

<p>
    where <b><code>YOUR_PHASE_BAND.img</code></b> stands for the name of the phase band that is to be unwrapped, and
    <b><code>99999</code></b> represents the number of lines of the <code>YOUR_PHASE_BAND</code>. <strong>Note</strong>
    that
    the command to be externally called for the phase unwrapping is listed in the header of <b><code>snaphu.conf</code></b>
    file
    that is created with the SNAPHU writer.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Again, it is strongly recommended that before doing any processing with SNAPHU user becomes
        familiar with the software and process control flags.</em>
