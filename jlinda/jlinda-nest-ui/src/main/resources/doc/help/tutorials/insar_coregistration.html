<h3>Coregistering&nbsp;InSAR&nbsp;Products</h3>

<p>
    The sub-pixel coregistration of SAR images is a strict requirement and critical component of any interferometric
    processing chain. It is an essential step for the accurate determination of phase difference, and applications such
    as DEM map generation, interferometric deformation analysis, etc.
</p>

<p><br>
    The interferometric modules of the toolbox will accurately&nbsp;co-register one&nbsp;or more&nbsp;slave images with
    respect to a master image. The co-registration procedure is completely automatic. Apart from defining the processing
    parameters, no additional input nor intervention from the user is required. For example the distribution
    of correlation (optimization) windows are done in automatic manner for both master and slave image. Also,
    the refinement of the coregistration offsets is done in a fully automatic way, including downloading and
    interpolation of the a-priori digitial-elevation-model.
</p>

<h4>Brief Implementation Details</h4>

<p><br>
    The implementation of the coregistration procedure is based on the cross-correlation technique. Since this technique
    for an optimal alignment tend to be slow for very large search windows, the procedure is usually separated in two
    main steps: <i>coarse</i> and <i>fine</i> coregistration. In the coarse coregistration, the offsets are approximated
    either by using the satellite orbits and timing as a reference, and/or by defining an approximate common points in
    master/slave images and performing correlation matching with large windows. The subsequent fine coregistration
    applies automation correlation technique to obtain sub-pixel alignment accuracy. After the coregistration offsets
    are computed, the estimation of the coregistration polynomial (CPM) and interferometric resampling of slave images
    to the master geometry is performed.
</p>

<h5>Comparison with 'Old' Coregistration Implementation</h5>

<p><br>
    Interferometric coregistration is fully implemented in the toolbox since NEST version 5. While there are
    conceptual overlaps with initial coregistration implementation, the algorithmic and implementation robustness
    is much higher and more optimal for the interferometric applications.
    <br><br>
    <b><u>For any interferometric application this is the recommended coregistration processing chain.</u></b>
</p>

<p><br>
    In future releases 'old' and 'interferometric' coregistration will be integrated into uniform processing chain.
</p>

<h4>Overview of Coregistration Processing Chain</h4>

<p><br>
    The interferometric coregistration is performed in three major processing steps (see Figure 1) with three operators:
    <a href="../operators/CreateInSARStackOp.html">Create InSAR Stack operator</a>,
    &nbsp;<a href="../operators/CoarseFineCoregOp.html">Coarse and Fine Coregistration operator</a> and
    &nbsp;<a href="../operators/ResampleOp.html">Coregistration Polynomial and Resampling operator</a>.

<h4>Input Images and Data Support</h4>

<p><br>
    Input SAR images may be fully ("full frame") or only partially overlapping ("subset"), they have to be
    from acquisitions taken at different times using compatible, in the interferometric sense, sensors, and input
    images must belong to the same type (i.e., them must be complex).
</p>

<p><br>
    While in principle the implementation of the InSAR coregistration is flexible enough to allow processing of real
    (detected) products, for now only complex (single-look-complex) data is supported.
</p>

</p><h4>Create InSAR Stack</h4>

<p>
    The Create InSAR Stack operator collocates the master and slave images based into a single reference (master)
    geometry. Basically the slave image data is subset into geometry of the master image. With performing this operation
    the master and slave images share the same geo-positioning information, and have the similar dimensions. For overlap
    and geometry calculation either orbital data, or annotated tie-point-grids (i.e., ground-control-points) can be
    used.
    In other words the coarse coregistration is performed using orbital information or annotated GCPs. The method based
    on orbits is recommended for all platforms, since especially in case of old sensors (ERS1/2) annotated GCPs prove
    not to be reliable through-out the whole mission lifetime.
</p>

<p><br>
    More details on this operator are given in the operator help -
    <a href="../operators/CreateInSARStack.html">Create InSAR Stack</a>.
</p>


<h4>Coarse and Fine Coregistration</h4>

<p><br>
    The Coarse and Fine Coregistration operator creates an alignment between master and slave images by matching
    automatically distributed correlation optimization windows to their corresponding slave windows. There are two
    steps: coarse and fine registration. The offsets between master and slave are computed by maximizing the
    cross-correlation between master and slave images on a series of imagettes defined across
    the images. First on coarse level, with large windows and lower oversampling factors, later on fine level, with
    smaller windows and higher oversampling factors.

</p>

<h4>Coregistration Polynomial (CPM) estimation and Resampling</h4>

<p><br>
    With the master-slave offsets computed, a coregistration polynomial (CPM) is estimated by the Resample operator,
    which resamples pixels in the slave image into pixels in the master image.
</p>

<p><br>
    This resampling is performend in two-steps: (1) reconstruction of the continuous signal from its sampled version by
    convolution with an interpolation kernel, and (2) sampling of the constructed signal at the new sampling locations.
</p>
