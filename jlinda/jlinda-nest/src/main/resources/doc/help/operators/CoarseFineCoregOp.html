<h3>Coarse and Fine InSAR Coregistration</h3>

<p>
    Coarse and Fine InSAR Coregistration is an operator of an <a href="../tutorials/insar_coregistration.html">
    interferometric coregistration processing chain.</a> The <i>Coarse and Fine Coregistration</i> Operator
    computes coregistration offsets between master and slave products.
</p>

<p><br>
    The computation of coregistration offsets is implemented in <i>coarse to fine</i> manner, and it is separated
    into two processing steps. First <i>coarse</i> computation of the coarse coregistration offsets is performed,
    and the coarse coregistration offset is refined in
    the <i>fine</i> step.
</p>

<h4>Operator Parameters</h4>

<p>
    The following parameters are used by this operator:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Number of Correlation Optimization Windows:</b> Number of windows to be distributed over the total image to
        estimate the master-slave offset.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Coarse Window Width and Height:</b> Size of the window in lines/pixels for coarse coregistration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Coarse Accuracy in Azimuth/Range direction:</b> The default method for the coarse
        offset computation is the 'Space Domain' that allows to define the accuracy to search within for the maximum
        correlation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Fine Correlation Method:</b> Method selector for the fine step. Compute cross-correlation based on magnitude
        image either in the space or the spectral domain. Note that the magnitude patches are zero mean-ed.
        The 'Frequency Domain' is fast, but patch size varies depending on shift. 'Space Domain' keeps constant
        patch-size and shifts it over the master, but is slower in comparison to the spectral method. In theory the
        'Spectral Method with Oversampling' is best, since it mitigates the aliasing of spectra when magnitude
        is computed (using FFTs), but it is also the slowest one. Recommended method is 'Frequency Domain' since it
        provides a good balance between robustness and computational efficiency.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Fine Window Width/Height:</b> The size of the correlation window. Recommended is 32 32.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Fine Accuracy in Azimuth/Range direction:</b> The search accuracy for the maximum correlation. This parameter
        applies only if 'Space Method' is selected. In that case advised is 8 8. Total search are from -Acc to +Acc.
        For Spectral Methods (based on FFT) methods accuracy automatically equals to half of the windows size.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Fine Oversampling Factor:</b> The oversampling factor for the harmonic
        interpolation of the correlation. Recommended value is minimum 16, and in order to co-register the images
        within a tenth of a pixel factor 32 is recommended.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Coherence Threshold:</b> Threshold for correlation value to use estimated offset of in the estimation of
        the corregistration polynomial. Note that estimated coherence using small windows are more biased towards 1.0,
        so a higher threshold is better. For window size 32 32 a threshold of 0.4 seems to give reliable results in most
        of the cases.
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Implementation Details</h4>

<h5>Coarse Coregistration - Overview</h5>

<p>
    The <i>coarse</i> offset in line (azimuth) and pixel (range) direction between master and slave is
    computed with an accuracy of about 1 pixel (1 offset for whole image). The magnitude images are used. The
    correlation is computed in the space or spectral domain.
</p>

<p>
    At a number of positions (geometrically distributed) in the image the correlation between master and slave is
    computed for different offsets. The offset with the highest correlation is the estimate for that position.
    The (approximate) offset between the two images is set to the offset that most occurred over the positions,
    so the one that is most likely and used as initial offset in the fine coregistration.
</p>

<p>
    Note that sometimes an estimated offset is totally unreliable, for example for a position in a sea, but the
    correlation is not very small. The estimated correlation at a position is likely to be biased. Therefore it
    would not be recommended to use the offset between the two images based purely on the highest correlation values.
    Thus this 'consistency test' is used instead.
</p>

<h5>Fine Coregistration - Overview</h5>

<p>
    The fine coregistration computes an offset vectors with sub pixel accuracy, that are used to align the slave
    to the master image. The offset vector computation is performed for a number of locations in the master image.
</p>

<p>
    Specifically, for a large number of windows over the total image (e.g., not less than 500), the offset between
    master and slave is estimated by computing the correlation of the magnitude images for shifts at pixel level.
    Further, in a local neighborhood of the maximum (correlation at pixel level) these correlations are harmonically
    oversampled (i.e., interpolated) to find the maximum at sub pixel level. These offsets are then stored to the
    product (metadata) file. The offset can be computed in the spectral or in the space domain. The correlation is
    computed on the magnitude images.
</p>

<h5>Method: 'Space Domain'</h5>


<p>
    The implementation in the space domain requires an odd window size, which is automatically forced. This
    restriction is not strictly necessary by the method, but was introduced to relax the implementation requirements
    - since it is easier to the center of the shifting window if window is defined at a pixel. For each location the
    (zero mean-ed) slave magnitude window is shifted over the (zero mean) master window, and the correlation is computed
    by computing all point wise products and dividing by the norms of the particular windows.
</p>

<h5>Method: 'Frequency Domain'</h5>

<p>
    In the nutshell the implementation in the frequency domain similar to the one the space domain. The main 
    difference is that FFT's are used to compute the products for the correlation in an efficient way, due to the
    fact that a convolution in the space domain corresponds to a multiplication in the frequency domain. Input are the 
    zero mean magnitude images.
</p>

<p>
    The cross products are obtained by computing the point wise product of the zero-padded master * conj(slave). A 
    block function is used to compute the norms. Note that the correlation window (the overlap) does not have a constant
    size with this method, but varies between winsizeL/P and .5winsizeL/P, thus can bias slightly the coherence estimate.
