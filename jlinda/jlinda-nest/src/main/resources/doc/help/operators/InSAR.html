<!--<h3>InSAR</h3><p>Interformetry will soon be available via a Java port of the Delft Object-oriented Radar Interferometric Software (<a class="wiki external" target="_blank" href="http://enterprise.lr.tudelft.nl/doris/" rel="external">DORIS</a>) implemented by TUDelft.</p><p>-->

<h3>InSAR functionality of NEST</h3>

<p>
    NEST-4B release brings the major update to interferometric functionality.
    As algorithmic prototype the DORIS (Delft object-oriented radar
    interferometric software) software has been used. Moreover, all
    implemented algorithms are fully documented and described in the
    literature and follow generally accepted best practices.
</p>

<p>
    The interferometric processing is setup in a similar way like for
    the other functionalities of NEST. The set of interferometric
    operators is designed and chained into the graph via the Graph
    Processing Framework. Moreover, where needed some of the core
    functionalities of NEST are improved to accommodate for the
    interferometry requirements (e.g. extension of Warping function
    with "phase preserving" and more accurate interpolation kernels).
</p>

<!--<p>-->
    <!--The&nbsp;interferometric functionalities currently are somewhat limited, though it provides enough features for the-->
    <!--basic interferometric processing and analysis.-->
