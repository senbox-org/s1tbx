<h3>Cross Interferometry Resampling</h3>

<p>
    This operator prepares input, ERS1/2 and Envisat, data for cross interferometric processing. The input image is 
    resampled to the requested geometry. For example, for Cross InSAR, with ERS image as a master Envisat ASAR image 
    should be resampled into the geometry of ERS to allow reliable corregistration.  
</p>

<h4>Operator Parameters</h4>

<p>
    The following parameters are used by this operator:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Interpolation Polynomial Degree:</b> Degree of two-dimensional polynomial. Degree 2 is advised.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Interpolation Method:</b> List of interpolation kernels.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Target Geometry:</b> List of target geometry. For example, to resample ERS to ASAR geometry, select ASAR.
    </li>
</ul>
    
<h4>Important Usability Note</h4>

<p>This operator is designed and implemented having having in mind data acquired during dedicated ERS2 - Envisat 
    Tandem Campaigns. For successful computation of Cross InSAR interferograms, between ERS/Envisat data, a 
    perpendicular baseline of approximately 2km is required. For the regular smaller baselines the results will be
    suboptimal, if not completely decorrelated.
</p>


<h4>Implementation Details</h4>

<p>
    Basically this operator performs estimation of the resampling polynomial, and resampling of input image from the 
    source into the target geometry using a deterministic relationship between source/target geometries. In this 
    case, this deterministic, relationship is defined by ratios of azimuth resolution (governed by 
    Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF)) and range resolution (governed by Range Sampling Rate (RSR)) - see Figure 1. 
    Ratios between source and target resolution is used to compute a deterministic offsets between geometries, 
    than these offsets are used to compute polynomial and resample geometries.

<h4>Known Issues</h4>

<p>
    Because of limited support for different types of orbits in <i>Apply Orbit Operator</i> of NEST, fringes in range 
    direction might be observed. Specifically the range phase ramps can be observed because of the missing support for 
    the <A HREF="http://www.deos.tudelft.nl/ers/precorbs/orbits/">ERS-2 EIGEN-GRACE01S precise orbits</A>. This issue 
    will be addressed in one of the future updates of the core modules of NEST.
</p>

<p>
    Alternatively, as a ad-hoc solution for this problem, the user can export the interferometric results from NEST, 
    and post process them for removal of the phase ramp in 3rd party software (e.g., Matlab, Octave, etc).
