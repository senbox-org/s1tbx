<p>Multi-Angle pre-processing takes a two C-band Quad Pol SLC
    products as input - a morning acquistion and an evening acquisition for
    the same date over the same area.</p>

<p>The order does not matter however, one product should be
    specified in the Read operator and the other in the Read(2) operator.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The processing graph
    applies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Radiometric calibration to Sigma0</li>
    <li>Mean 3x3 speckle filtering</li>
    <li>Terrain correction using the SRTM 3sec DEM and map
        projection to WGS84 Lat/Lng geographic coordinates
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The
    multi-angle soil moisture retrieval requires that the terrain
    correction operator output the incidence angle from the ellipsoid as a
    band.</p>

<p>The two terrain corrected results are then combined into a
    single product stack.</p>

<p>Pre-processing could also be applied from outside the Toolbox.
    In
    this case, the input product must adhere to the following input product
    conditions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The input product must be calibrated to Sigma0</li>
    <li>All
        required source bands, namely, sigma0HH, sigma0VV
        and&nbsp;Incidence
        Angle&nbsp;must be present in a single input source product.
    </li>
    <li>The
        sigma0HH band name should contain "Sigma0_HH" or "HH" with "Sigma0_HH"
        taking precedence meaning that if a band whose name contains
        "Sigma0_HH" is found, other bands whose name contains "HH" will be
        ignored.
    </li>
    <li>The sigma0VV band name should contain "Sigma0_VV" or "VV"
        with "Sigma0_VV" taking precedence.
    </li>
    <li>If no unit is specified for the sigma0 bands or the unit is
        not decibel (dB), the sigma0 values will be converted to dB.
    </li>
    <li>The
        incidence angle band could be local incidence angle (LIA) or incidence
        angles from the ellipsoid. Incidence angles should be in degrees.
    </li>
    <li>The incidence angle band name should contain
        "incidenceAngle" or "LIA" with "incidenceAngle" taking precedence.
    </li>
    <li>It is assumed that the input product contains both AM and
        PM acquisitions in a coregistered stack.
    </li>
</ol>
