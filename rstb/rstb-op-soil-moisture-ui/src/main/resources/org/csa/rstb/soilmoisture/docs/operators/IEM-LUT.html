<p>The LUT consists of two files: a header file and a data file.<br><br>The
    header and data files for a LUT should have the same filename (but with
    different extensions) and they should reside in the same folder.<br><br>The header file is a simple text file with
    extension ".luthdr". It must contain, among others, the following three lines:<br>Start_angle = m<br>Stop_angle =
    n<br>Number_of_rows_per_angle = k<br>where<br>m is an integer that represents the start incidence angle in
    degrees<br>n is an integer that represents the stop incidence angle in degrees<br>k is the number of rows per
    integral angle<br><br>The data file can be a binary Matlab file (extension ".mat") or a text CSV file (extension
    ".csv").<br><br>An Original IEM LUT must have exactly 5 columns in this order:<br>rms (cm), cl (cm), RDC (Farad/m),
    sigmaHH (dB), sigmaVV (dB)<br><br>A Calibrated IEM LUT must have exactly 4 columns in this order:<br>rms (cm), RDC
    (Farad/m), sigmaHH (dB), sigmaVV (dB)<br><br>The number of rows in the LUT should be:<br>Number_of_rows_per_angle *
    (Stop_angle - Start_angle + 1)<br><br>The
    (rms, cl, RDC) block in an Original IEM LUT are assumed to be
    replicated across angles, meaning that the (rms, cl, RDC) values
    corresponding to the same row of two different angle blocks are the
    same. The same assumption applies to a Calibrated IEM LUT.</p>
