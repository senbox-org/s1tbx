<h3>Polarimetric Speckle Filter Operator</h3><p>SAR images have
inherent salt and pepper like texturing called &#8216;speckle&#8217; which degrades
the quality of the image and makes interpretation of features more
difficult. The presence of speckle intensity fluctuations in
single-look complex SAR imagery is an inevitable consequence of the
nature of coherent image formation. Each radar resolution cell contains
multiple individual scatters, each of which contributes to the overall
signal returned from the resolution cell. Since the radar wavelength is
normally much smaller than the size of the resolution cell, the phase
obtained from each individual scatterer is effectively random. The
signals from each scatter may be summed according to the principle of
superposition, which results in constructive and destructive
interference. Cells where destructive interference dominates will
appear to have a low reflectivity, while cells where constructive
interference dominates will appear to have a high reflectivity. This
leads to the phenomenon of speckle. It may be shown thatthe speckle
intensity is exponentiallydistributed.</p><p>While the presence of
speckle in a SAR image can impair qualitative interpretation of the
image, speckle is even more problematic when interpreting SAR data in a
quantitative manner. In particular, the reliability of image
segmentation techniques is adversely-effected by the presence of
speckle.</p><p>For polarimetric SAR data, the speckle filtering is
based on incoherent averaging and requires handling statistical second
order representations. Thus the speckle filtering is applied to
covariance or coherency matrix.</p><p>This operator provides the following polarimetric speckle filterings:</p><ul><li>Box Car filter</li><li>Refined Lee flter</li>
  <li>IDAN filter<br>
  </li>
  <li>Improved Lee Sigma filter<br>
  </li>
</ul><h4>Box Car Filter</h4><p>The
box car filter is a direct application of the incoherent averaging of
the covariance/coherency matrix over pixels in a neighborhood defined
by a sliding window. The boxcar filter presents the best filtering
performance over homogeneous areas. However there are two major
drawbacks with the box car filter:</p><ul><li><span style="color: red;"></span>the sharp edges are generally blurred</li><li><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"></span>point scatterers are over filtered and transformed to spread targets</li></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The refined Lee filter introduced below does not have these limitations.<br><h4>Refined Lee Filter</h4><p>The
refine Lee filter is a minimum mean square error (MMSE) filter and was
developed based on the multiplicative noise model. One major deficiency
with the MMSE filter is that speckle noise near strong edges is not
adequately filtered. To compensate this problem, &nbsp;the refined Lee
filter uses a nonsquare window to match the direction of edges. The
filter operated in a 7x7 (or 9x9, 11x11) sliding window. One of eight
edge-aligned windows&nbsp;is selected to filter the center pixel. Only
the pixels&nbsp;in the non-edge area&nbsp;in the&nbsp;edge-aligned
window are used in the filtering computation.</p><p>The filter follows&nbsp;three major processing steps as given below:</p><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Edge-aligned window selection</span>: For each pixel,&nbsp;span image is used in selecting the&nbsp;edge-aligned window.</li><li><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Filtering weight computation</span>: The local statistical filter is applied to the span image to compute the weight <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>.</li><li><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Filter the covariance matrix</span>: The same weight <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span> (a scalar) and the same selected window are used to filter each element of&nbsp;matrix, <span style="font-style: italic;">Z</span>, independently and equally. The filtered&nbsp;matrix is then given by</li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 145px; height: 32px;" alt="" src="images/polarimetricSpeckleFilterOp_eq1.jpeg"></div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; where<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img style="width: 22px; height: 29px;" alt="" src="images/polarimetricSpeckleFilterOp_eq2.jpeg"></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">is the local mean of&nbsp;matrices computed with pixels in the same edge-directed window.<br></p><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
<h4>IDAN Filter</h4>
<p>Conventional filtering method selects pixels from homogeneous areas
in a fixed size sliding window.&nbsp; The drawback with this approach
is that the number of pixels selected may not be sufficient to reduce
the estimation variance.&nbsp; Instead of limiting&nbsp; the pixel
selection in a fixed size window, the IDAN (Intensity-Driven
Adaptive-Neighborhood) filter selects pixels with region growing
techniques and criteria of the Lee sigma filter. In this algorithm, an
adaptive neighborhood is determined for each pixel by a region growing
technique. The pixel is then filtered with the MMSE filter computed
using all selected pixels. The region growing technique consists of two
stages:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In stage 1, pixels within one sigma range are selected. This is the initial growing.</li>
  <li>In stage 2, pixels that are rejected in the initial growing are
re-examined.&nbsp; Pixels that are within two sigma range are also
selected in the final adaptive neighborhood. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Improved Lee Sigma Filter</h4>

<p>The Lee Sigma filter proposed in [4] assumes Gaussian noise
distribution and filters the center pixel in a sliding window with the
average of pixels within the two-sigma range. One major drawback of the
algorithm is that the mean of pixels within the two-sigma range is
always underestimated due to the fact that the noise distributions are
not symmetric and the symmetric thresholds are used in the pixel
selection. The new Lee Sigma filter [3] extends and improves the Lee
Sigma filter in the following aspects:<br>
</p>

<ul>
<li> The bias problem is solved by redefining the sigma range based on the speckle probability density functions. </li>
  <li>A target signature preservation technique is developed to prevent point target from being filtered.</li>
<li>The minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) estimator is used for adaptive speckle reduction.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Input and Output</h4><ul><li>The
input to this operator can be full polarimetric data, it can also be covariance or coherency
matrix produced by Polarimetric Matrix Generation operator.</li><li>The output of this operator is the&nbsp;corresponding filtered matrix.</li></ul><ol>
</ol><h4>Parameters Used</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; For box car filter, the following processing parameters are used&nbsp;by the operator (see Figure 1):<br><ul><li>Speckle Filter:&nbsp; the box car speckle filter</li><li>Filter Size: the dimension of the sliding window used in averaging covariance/coherency matrix</li></ul><br>
