<h3>Decision Tree Operator</h3>

<p>The Decision Tree allows for the creation of a rule-based
    classifier. Rules operate on a per-pixel basis as a Band Maths operation.&nbsp;</p>

<p> The Decision Tree has <span style="font-weight: bold;">Decision Nodes</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Leaf Nodes</span>.
    Each
    decision node
    consists of a boolean Band Math expression. A leaf node can contain a
    single value such as a class index or a band name to produce the value
    at that pixel from that band.</p>

<p>Right
    click on a leaf node to add a new decision node. The leaf node will
    then be replaced by a decision node with two new leaf nodes.</p>

<p>Double
    click on the decision node to call up the expression editor. You may
    enter any kind of boolean expression using bands from the currently
    opened products or the connected source products within a graph.</p>
