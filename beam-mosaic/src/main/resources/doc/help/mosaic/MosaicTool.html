<p>The main intention of the Mosaic Processor is to provide an alternative level 3 algorithm that is able to
    create Moir&eacute;-free images. Especially when the pixel size of the input product(s) and the bin size of the
    target L3 product are of the same order of magnitude, the Mosaic Processor yields better results than the Binning
    Processor when exact statistics are not an requirement. Furthermore, the generated level 3 products are well
    suited for the production of images (e.g. RGB compositions).</p>

<p>Features of the Mosaic Processor:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use of any number of <a href="MosaicAlgorithmSpecification.html#OV">output variables</a> for the level 3 output
        product.
        An output variable is defined by an expression, which computes the pixel values.</li>
    <li>Definition of <a href="MosaicAlgorithmSpecification.html#VPC">valid pixel criteria</a> which include or exclude
        pixels with certain
        properties by using boolean expressions. All the defined criterias can be combined using the AND or OR.</li>
    <li>If you are interested in how many times any of the criteria have been fulfilled for each pixel,
        the counts of each criterion can be written into extra bands in the output product. Such extra bands
        take the name of the criterion.</li>
</ul>
