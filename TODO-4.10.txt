Further development towards TrackPoints
=======================================

- Remove most calls to Placemark.createPointPlacemark():
  * Many of those calls copy placemarks from one VDN to another, although this will
    not be required anymore: we only need to copy VDN and their features. Then, placemarks
    will be created accordingly. This basically already implemented in
    ProductUtils.copyVectorData(source, target). Therefore we'll implement the capability
    of a VDN to create corresponding Placemarks whenever features are added.
    (Check: And vice versa?). Placemark collections will then stay in sync with feature
    collection. Also this is already implemented in PlacemarkGroup.
  * Analyse args of remaining calls: which are Pins, which GCPs, how general are these?
    e.g.: PointPlacemarkDescriptor.createPointPlacemark(<point-args>)
  * We don't store pins in DIMAP anymore, all placemarks will be stored in the same way.
- How will we import & export placemarks with respect to their underlying features.
  Will we only export features? No, this way we won't get all associated (sample) data
  for point placemarks.
- Action "Create new geometry container" --> "Create new feature collection" or
  "vector data node", users should also select feature type. BUT where do feature types
  come from? We have no registry. We have PlacemarkDescriptors. Shall users select
  from registered PlacemarkDescriptors? Then these must provide (default / basis) feature
  type. BUT then: How can they be responsible for (compatible with) more than one feature
  type?
    Possible idea: Every PlacemarkDescriptor produces a unique feature type and only features of
    exactly this type. Users must make a choice, when multiple PlacemarkDescriptors match the
    same feature type. This will happen when
    1. importing data (e.g. shapefiles)
    2. creating new vector data nodes (see "Create new geometry container")
    We might need something like dynamic features that are created for point features
    while bands are added or removed --> dynamic feature type (feature type extender, or
    "runtime feature type")
- When copying VDNs --> rename ones with same name that exist before
- Remove ProductProjectionBuilder but usage in MosaicProcessor: is it still required?
- Remove all redundant calls to PinDescriptor.getInstance()
- Remove all redundant calls to GcpDescriptor.getInstance()
- Remove VectorDataGroupTN.mustCount(), because there is later no need to differentiate
- Ease access from Figure (selection) to specific Placemarks + Features
- InsertPlacemarkInteractor --> InsertPointPlacemarkInteractor

- Discuss following roles
  * VectorDataNode:
    + feature type / placemark descriptor
    + collection of placemarks
  * Placemark (VectorDataItem)
    + placemark descriptor
    + feature

Revise data import / export
  - harmonise flat, plain text data table I/O
    - exported pin files
    - vector data node I/O
    - pixel extraction, transect data extraction
    - PixExOp
    - PixBox
    - Calvalus in-situ data / pixel extraction
    - VISAT copy to clipboard actions
  - text data table I/O shall be done using a transfer object that comprises a property map plus a feature collection
  - feature type attribute naming: camel-case or underscore?
  - format proposal:

    property-record        := '#'<property-name> '=' <property-value>
    attribute-header       := <attribute-name> [<attribute-type-spec>]
    attribute-type-spec    := ':'<attribute-type>
    feature-format         := {<property-record> NL} <feature-type-record> {NL <feature-record>}
    simple-format          := {<property-record> NL} <header-record>       {NL <data-record>}
    feature-type-record    := '@'<feature-type-name> {<sep> <attribute-header>}
    feature-record:        := <feature-id>           {<sep> <attribute-value>}
    header-record          := <attribute-header> {<sep> <attribute-header>}
    data-record:           := <attribute-value>  {<sep> <attribute-value>}
    sep:                   := TAB | [';' | ',', ...]  (TBC)

    Special-meaning attribute names may be auto-detected by BEAM:
    - lat, latitude
    - lon, long, longitude
    - time, date, date_time, dateTime
    - station, easting, northing
    Attribute format detection may apply if <attribute-type-spec> is missing
    - number, date, time
    Must specify which coordinate system


- Revise Spectrum view
  - use JFreeChart
  - lines are too thin!
  - fixed axis ranges!!!


- Revise profile plot with respect to reference data
    - shall operate on selected vector data nodes
      - if VDN contains points geometry types:
           - points are vertexes
           - each point may provide reference data (feature attributes)
           - the GUI lets the user select an attribute to be displayed
           - color used is the point color (pin)
      - if VDN contains shapes
           - for each shape a profile is drawn using the shape's color
           - the selected shape may be also hi-lighted in the chart
           - option to only display selected shape
    - possibly visualise time difference   (separate plot)
    - optionally hide points with to large time delta

- revise scatter plot with respect to reference data
    - extend existing or create a 2nd scatter plot panel for in-situ data comparisons
    - allow to select vector data nodes containing point data as 2nd variable (feature attribute name)
      In this case, data pairs are generated by reading pixel data at each given point and its attribute value
    - display statistics
    - allow for macro pixels (see Calvalus match-up scenario)
    - possibly visualise time difference
    - optionally hide points with to large time delta

- Revise PixExOp according to following use cases
    - It shall be possible to import coordinates in two different ways:
        - Import coordinates only (without time information)
          This is needed if a pixel extraction for all input products is needed, not only for products
          which matches the time.
          The Name inside the Popup Menu should be "Load Coordinates"
          In this case the import file must have a "name", "station" or "label" column.
          All the coordinates with the same name are interpreted as one coordinate.
          If the coordinates with one name are slightly different the first coordinate will be imported.
        - Import coordinates and Time
          already implemented!
          The Name inside the Popup Menu should be changed to "Load coordinates and time"
    - It should be possible to define a filename pattern for date extraction
        - There should be a text input field to define a date pattern
            e.g.  yyyyMMdd    20120524   ->  24.5.2012
        - There should be a text input field to define filename pattern
            e.g.   *${date}_????????_${date}_????????_*.dim
            LL_K2PIS_20120524_13692749_bas_20120601_21875615_rim_dum.dim
            --> Start Time = 24.5.2012
            --> Stop Time =  1.6.2012
    - It should be possible to define different output formats
        - Default output format  ---> is a valid CALVALUS import file
        - ODESA output format  ---> there are scripts existing in AR which can be translated to Java which defines
                                    exactly the needs for a valid ODESA import file.
                                    For ODESA there should be exported two files.
                                       One with all the exported data
                                       One with aggregated data like mean, median, standard deviation, ...
        - user defined Export
            - one column time export
                there should be a text field to define a date/time output pattern
            - two columns time export
                there should be two text fields
                the first one is for the date pattern
                the second one is for the time pattern
            - in the case of two columns export it should be able to define a time fill value
                "noTime", "00:00", ...
            - in all this cases, it should be possible to pick from predefined date or time patterns
            - in the case, that a user defined export is not selected, all the fields should
              be visible but not enabled. Inside the fields, the defined export format (default
              od ODESA) should be visible.
