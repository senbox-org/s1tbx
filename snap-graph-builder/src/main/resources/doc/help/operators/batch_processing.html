<h3>Batch Processing</h3>

<p>The Batch Processing tool available via the
    DAT allows you to execute a single reader/writer graph for a set of
    products. Select the Batch Processing tool from the Graphs menu and
    then press the "Load" button to browse for a previously saved graph.
    Next, add products in the IO tab by pressing the "Add" button or
    dragging and dropping a ProductSet or Products from the Project or
    Products views. Set the target folder where the output will be written
    to and then press "Run".</p>

<p>Batch Processing can also be called from within the Product Library.
    In the&nbsp;Product Library, select the products you would like to import and
    then press the Batch Processing button. In this way you may pre-process
    a list of products before working with them in the DAT.</p>
