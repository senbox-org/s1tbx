<h3>The user interface</h3>

<h4>I/O Parameters</h4>

<p>
    Using the I/O Parameters tab, the input products can be set, as well as the target product's name and target directory.
    See the screenshot below.
</p>

<p>
    <img src="images/ui_io_parameters.png">
</p>

<p>
    When the Run-button is clicked, the binning is performed according to the preferences that are specified in the
    "Filter-" and the "Configuration"-tabs.
</p>

<h4>Filter</h4>

<p>
    Two filters can be applied to limit the contents of the target product. See the screenshot below for the user
    interface for the filters.
</p>

<p>
    <img src="images/ui_filters.png">
</p>

<h5>Specify target region</h5>

<p>
    The target region filter can be used to set the bounds of the target product. It is able to operate in four
    different modes:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        the bounds of the target product are inferred by the bounds of all inputs products; that is, the smallest
        rectangular bounding box that contains all input products is being used.
    </li>
    <li>
        the whole globe is used as region for the target product
    </li>
    <li>
        the bounds of the target product are given by a user-provided WKT, according to this
        <a href="http://docs.geotools.org/stable/javadocs/org/opengis/referencing/doc-files/WKT.html">specification</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        the region of the target product can be drawn and entered using a dedicated world map component
    </li>
</ol>

<h5>
    Specify temporal filtering
</h5>

<p>
    The temporal filter can be used in order to specify time bounds the source products have to comply with. Source
    products that are not within these time bounds are not considered for level-3 generation. If the filter shall be
    used, both a start date and an end date must be supplied. The following rules apply:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        If the product has a start time and an end time, the product is filtered out if its start time lies before the
        specified start time or its end time lies after the specified end time.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the product has a start time, but no end time, the product is filtered out if its start time lies before the
        specified start time.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the product has an end time, but no start time, the product is filtered out if its end time lies after the
        specified end time.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the product has neither start nor end time, it is never filtered out.
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Configuration</h4>

The third tab allows the user to supply the general binning configuration. See the screenshot below for an example.

<p>
    <img src="images/ui_configuration.png">
</p>

<h5>The bands table</h5>

<p>
    Using the table, the user can specify the bands that shall appear in the target product. Using the <i>plus</i> and
    <i>minus</i> buttons, bands can be added and removed.<br>
    Each row in the table determines one or multiple output bands, depending on the aggregation method being chosen. If,
    for example, the aggregation method AVG (average) is chosen in the third column, the target product will contain two
    bands written by this output method: 1) the mean, 2) the standard deviation.<br>
    In the first column, bands can be chosen. Either bands that are contained in the products the user entered in the
    <i>IO Parameters</i> tab can be chosen, or band math expressions can be set by choosing the band
    <i>&lt;expression_x&gt;</i>. In the latter case, a band maths expression can be entered in the second column, so that e.g.
    simple algorithms such as NDVI can be computed on-the-fly.<br>
    The <i>weight</i> and <i>percentile</i> columns are used only for specific aggregation methods.<br>
    See the following table on valid input for the standard aggregators:
</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Aggregator</td>
            <td>Description</td>
            <td>Weight</td>
            <td>Percentile</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>PERCENTILE</td>
            <td>An aggregator that computes the p-th percentile.</td>
            <td>not considered</td>
            <td>integer value between 0 and 100</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>AVG_ML</td>
            <td>An aggregator that computes a maximum-likelihood average.</td>
            <td>any float value, not NaN</td>
            <td>not considered</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>AVG</td>
            <td>An aggregator that computes a maximum-likelihood average.</td>
            <td>any float value > 0.0, not NaN</td>
            <td>not considered</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>MIN_MAX</td>
            <td>An aggregator that computes the minimum and maximum values.</td>
            <td>not considered</td>
            <td>not considered</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>ON_MAX_SET</td>
            <td>An aggregator that sets an output if an input is maximal.</td>
            <td>not considered</td>
            <td>not considered</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

<p>
    The fill value can be set for all aggregation methods -- this is the value being set to the pixel if the aggregation
    method yields no sensible value. This might happen if no valid source pixels are found for the pixel.
</p>

<h5>Valid expression and target height</h5>

<p>
    Using the valid expression, the user can specify which values in the source products shall be considered. Thus, a
    boolean expression has to be set here. In the configuration of the example screenshot, only pixels that are not over
    land are considered.<br>
    The target height of the source product may be set, too; this value has direct influence on the spatial resolution.
</p>

<h5>Supersampling</h5>

<p>
    As long as the area of an input pixel is small compared to the area of a bin,
    a simple binning is sufficient. In this case,
    the geodetic center coordinate of the Level 2 pixel is used
    to find the bin in the Level 3 grid whose area is intersected by this point.
    If the area of the contributing pixel is equal or even larger than the bin area,
    this simple binning will produce composites with insufficient accuracy and
    visual artifacts such as Moir&eacute; effects will dominate the resulting datasets.</p>

<p>
    The following figure illustrates this problem.</p>

<p>
    <img src="images/chessGrid.png">
</p>

<p><i>Level 2 grid (blue) and Level 3 grid (yellow)</i></p>

<p>The blue chessboard grid refers to the input data,
    the yellow one refers to the final Level 3 grid. As the figure clearly shows,
    single Level 2 pixels cannot be uniquely be assigned to single bins.</p>

<p>
    Supersampling parameter can be used to reduce or avoid the Moir&eacute; effect.
    The Moir&eacute; effect usually occurs when the spatial resolution used for the
    binning is similar to or smaller than the input pixel resolution. The supersampling
    subdivides every input pixel to n x n subpixels which all have the same values but
    different and unique geographical coordinates. This way, an input pixel may be
    distributed to more than one adjacent bin cell.
</p>

<h5>Output binned data</h5>

<p>
    It is not only possible to write a target product in the standard format (that is, the binned data is mapped on a
    rectangular lat/lon grid), but also to a NetCDF file whose contents are in compliance with the NASA Ocean Colour
    Level-3 binned data products, as described
    <a href="http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/DOCS/Ocean_Level-3_Binned_Data_Products.pdf">here</a>.
