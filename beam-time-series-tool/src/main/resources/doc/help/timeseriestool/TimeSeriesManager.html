<p>
    This page comprises a short definition of Time Series in the context of the BEAM Time Series Tool, and describes
    how such Time Series are created and edited using the Time Series Manager tool.
</p>

<h4>Time Series</h4>

<p>
    Within the Time Series Tool, a <i>time series</i> is specified by several source products and variables. Every product
    comprising remote-sensing bands may be used as source product of a time series.
    However, products need to share at least one remote-sensing band in order to create a meaningful time series.
    A time series comprises several bands of the same variable, for example, 4 bands of <code>TSM_mean</code>,
    each originating from a different source product.
</p>

<h4>Time Series Manager Tool</h4>

<p>
    The <i>Time Series Manager</i>, opened by a click on <img src="../images/ts-manager-button.gif" alt="ts-manager-button" />,
    allows to manage time series in a broad sense. In short, it allows the user to
    <ul>
        <li>create a time series</li>
        <li>import in-situ data</li>
        <li>map band names</li>
        <li>edit a time series' time frame</li>
        <li>view a time series</li>
        <li>export a time series</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    Screenshot 1 shows the time series manager in its initial state.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <div align="center"><font size="2">Screenshot 1 - Time Series Manager in initial state</font></div>
</div>

<p>
    The point of entry is the <i>Time Series Wizard</i>, which is started by clicking on
    <img src="../images/New24.gif" alt="new-button">. It allows the user to specify source products in three
    different ways: either a directory is scanned for products or a directory is scanned together with its
    sub-directories, or single products may be chosen (see Screenshot 2).
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <div align="center"><font size="2">Screenshot 2 - Defining Time Series source products</font></div>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    If all specified products are on the same grid and have the same bounds, the following step is skipped. If not, the
    products need to be reprojected for the time series. Reprojection is done by specifying an already projected
    reference product and using its CRS and its bounds. Therefore, these reference products needs to intersect the
    products which shall appear in the time series. See Screenshot 3 for the wizard's reprojection page.
</p>

    <div align="center"><font size="2">Screenshot 3 - Reprojecting time series source products</font></div>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    In the next step, the wizard allows to specify the variables the time series shall contain. The list of possible
    variables is derived from the products which have been chosen in the previous step. This step is displayed in
    Screenshot 4.

    <div align="center"><font size="2">Screenshot 4 - Specifying the variables</font></div>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    After that, the user may assign the time series a name and finish the wizard. See Screenshot 5.
</p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    After the wizard is finished, the Time Series Manager now looks as displayed in Screenshot 6.

<h4>
    General Information
</h4>
<p>
    On the upper left, there are provided some general information about the time series, such as the start and end
    time, the CRS and the dimensions. In the upper middle, the variables from the bands may be selected and de-selected.
    Only selected variables are featured in the time series, thus, if a variable becomes de-selected, it is instantly
    excluded from the time series.
    <br>On the upper right, in-situ variables may be added or removed. The lower panel displays the product sources and
    allows the user to add or remove products of the time series.
</p>

<h4>
    Buttons at the right side
</h4>
<p>
    On the panel's right, there are a number of buttons which become active after creating the time series.
</p>

<h5>
    Import in-situ data
</h5>
<p>
    The <img src="../images/Import24.gif" alt="insitu-button">-button allows the user to load in-situ data from a
    CSV-file. The columns within that file need to be tab (char='\t') separated.
    <br> See listing 1 for an exemplary in-situ source file.
</p>

<table border="0" style="left: 5px; top: 5px; background-color:#f0f0f0">
    <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>Lon</td>
        <td>Lat</td>
        <td>Time</td>
        <td>Fo</td>
        <td>CHL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>AMRU2</td>
        <td>7.8333</td>
        <td>54.6667</td>
        <td>2010-01-23 01:21</td>
        <td>19.9</td>
        <td>0.46</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>DTEND</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>55.5</td>
        <td>2010-01-25 18:35</td>
        <td>16.9</td>
        <td>0.39</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>DTEND</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>55.5</td>
        <td>2010-01-25 19:35</td>
        <td>16.8</td>
        <td>0.41</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="6" align="center" style="font-size: 10px;"><p>&nbsp</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="6" align="center">Listing 1 - An exemplary in-situ source file</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    The import mechanism automatically detects columns for station name, latitude, longitude, and time. All
    other columns are interpreted as measurement parameter.
    <br>Note that all valid column names are case insensitive.
</p>

<table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
<tr><th>Column</th><th>valid names</th></tr>
<tr><td>Latitude</td><td>"lat", "latitude", "northing"</td></tr>
<tr><td>Longitude</td><td>"lon", "long", "longitude", "easting"</td></tr>
<tr><td>Time</td><td>"time", "date"</td></tr>
<tr><td>Station name</td><td>"name", "station", "label"</td></tr>
</table>

<h5>
    Names Association<a name="associations"> </a>
</h5>
<p>
    On click on the <img src="../images/NamesAssociation24.gif" alt="namesAssociation-button">-Button, the names association dialog
    (see Screenshot 7) opens.
</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="../images/names-association.png" alt="ts-manager">
<br> Screenshot 7 - Names Association
</div>

<p>
    That dialog allows the user to create a mapping between satellite and in-situ data. This is needed if the names
    in the satellite products are different from the names within the in-situ data, but shall be handled equally.
    The first step is to create a new alias name (in the example 'algal_2') and then choose from the list of band names
    and the list of in-situ variable names the names which are to be grouped within that alias. Multiple list entries
    from a single list may be chosen by holding the <i>Ctrl</i>-button while clicking.
</p>

<p>
    The <img src="../images/edit-time-span-button.png" alt="edit-time-span-button">-button allows to edit the valid time
    span of the time series. The respective dialog is shown in Screenshot 8. Products whose time bounds do not fit into
    the time span specified in the tool are excluded from the time series.
</p>

<div class="image">
    <img src="../images/edit-time-span.png" alt="ts-manager">
    <div align="center"><font size="2">Screenshot 8 - Edit time span</font></div>
</div>

<p>
    The <img src="../images/view-button.png" alt="view-button">-button allows the user to show one of the selected variables in
    the VISAT Product Scene View.
