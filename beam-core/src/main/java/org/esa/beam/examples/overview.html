This is the documentation for the Java source code examples provided along with
the BEAM Software. It shows the basic concepts on how to use the BEAM Java API
for your own applications:

<ul>
    <li>{@link org.esa.beam.examples.data_export}: very simple examples showing how to read data
        from a product and write them out: The package conatins three source
        files:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="{@docRoot}/data_export/BandWriterMain.java.txt">BandWriterMain.java</a></li>
            <li><a href="{@docRoot}/data_export/BitmaskWriterMain.java.txt">BitmaskWriterMain.java</a></li>
            <li><a href="{@docRoot}/data_export/TiePointGridWriterMain.java.txt">TiePointGridWriterMain.java</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>{@link org.esa.beam.examples.ndvi_simple}: a very simple NDVI (normalized differential
        vegetation index) processor. The package contains a single source file:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="{@docRoot}/ndvi_simple/NdviSimpleMain.java.txt">NdviSimpleMain.java</a>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>{@link org.esa.beam.examples.ndvi_processor}: a more advanced NDVI processor which uses parts
        of the BEAM processing framework. The example comprises two source files:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="{@docRoot}/ndvi_processor/NdviProcessorMain.java.txt">NdviProcessorMain.java</a>
            <li><a href="{@docRoot}/ndvi_processor/NdviProcessor.java.txt">NdviProcessor.java</a>
            <li><a href="{@docRoot}/ndvi_processor/NdviProcReq.xml">a NDVI processing request file</a>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    You can also download the bundled examples as a single <a href="{@docRoot}/../examples.zip">ZIP file</a>.
    In order to compile the examples, the ZIP file also contains a <code>build.xml</code> file for use
    with the open source tool
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/"><code>ant</code></a> (a kind of <code>make</code> for Java)
    developed by the <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Newcomers who want to develop export tools and data processors are invited to look at
    {@link org.esa.beam.examples.data_export} and {@link org.esa.beam.examples.ndvi_simple} first.
    The first package contains basic tools which lets you extract geophysical data from
    products. The {@link org.esa.beam.examples.ndvi_simple} package contains a few lines of code showing you how to
    compute the NDVI value from a MERIS Level 1b input product.
</p>

<p>
    Once you are familiar with the basic concepts, please examine the {@link org.esa.beam.examples.ndvi_processor}
    example
    contained in this package. {@link org.esa.beam.examples.ndvi_processor.NdviProcessorMain} implements is a
    fully functional data processor which uses some important concepts and mechanisms of the BEAM
    processing framework. Don't be afraid, it is still very easy code. It can be used as a template
    for your own data processors.
</p>


<p>This is the list of the most important API packages used by the examples:
    <ol>
        <li>
            <a href="{@docRoot}/../api-doc/org/esa/beam/framework/datamodel/package-summary.html">The <code>
                org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel</code> package.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="{@docRoot}/../api-doc/org/esa/beam/framework/dataio/package-summary.html">The <code>
                org.esa.beam.framework.dataio</code> package.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="{@docRoot}/../api-doc/org/esa/beam/util/package-summary.html">The <code>org.esa.beam.util</code>
                package.</a>
        </li>
    </ol>
