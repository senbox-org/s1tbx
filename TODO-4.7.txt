Reprojection:
=============
* Old org.esa.beam.framework.dataop.maptransf still heavily in use!
  Remove usage, deprecate and/or remove classes. Prefer deprecation.
  ==> FINAL, MZ, CLOSED (deprecated)

* Band Math --> Band Maths
  
Masks:
======
* We need a special mask type masking out no-data pixels. If no-data value
  is set, it shall be used in its raw form by the mask image (OpImage).
  If valid-expression is set, it shall be AND-ed with the no-data mask,
  if any.
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN
* We need a special mask type backed by a raster data buffer. Users shall
  be able to "paint" mask pixels (SYKE!). Also the "magic-stick" tool will #
  operate on such mask types. The raster data of the new mask type will need to
  be stored to disk.
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN

* Transfer Mask Dialog:
  Explain "descr" and "pixel" in dialog and help. Use an example.
  ==> FINAL , MZ, CLOSED
* ROI/Mask Manager: When deleting a "geometry mask" the associated geometry shall be deleted as well.
  Forbid deletion of "pin" and "placemark" masks!
  ==> FINAL , MZ, CLOSED
     
VectorDataNode:
===============
* Create subset from Product with Pins, GCPs -> GCPs outside of subset bounds are preserved, pins are not
  Explain in help, that this is intended.
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN

* Import of Geometry does not work when shapefile has no CRS and shapefile coordinates are not in WGS84.
  the user is asked to enter a CRS.
  ==> FINAL, MP, CLOSED

Figures:
========
* Still can not add/remove geometry vertices
  ==> FINAL, NF, OPEN

* Still can't rotate figures.
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), NF, OPEN
* Number of created vertex handles should be dependent on current viewport
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), NF, OPEN
* Still cannot draw true circles/squares and also adjust lines and points on grid.
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN
* New edit menu:
  - Test Cut/Copy/Paste!
  - What about Undo/Redo?!? (should work!)
  - After Paste: select inserted figures and displace a few (view) pixels
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN
* Allow for geometric operations on geometries: add/sub/intersection (JTS!)
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN

* Layer style editor doesn't work anymore. Support only our style. Not SLD.
  ==> FINAL, MP, CLOSED

Product tree:
=============
* Don't display empty groups. With special attention to Pin & GCP Vector Data Nodes.
  ==> FINAL, MP, ONGOING

Layers:
=======
* Don't use class names e.g. in Session I/O.
  ==> FINAL, MZ, CLOSED
* Graticule layer does not recognize preference changes (reported by Sean Bailey)
  Also No-data layer is affected.
  ==> FINAL, MP, CLOSED
  (OF:  Graticule layer will be update in the image view immediately, but  No-data not.
  For No-data update you must close and reopen image view. Is it OK?)
  (MP: fixed)

GPF Processors:
===============
* Clean up GPF packages:
  - split into beam-gpf and beam-gpf-meris
  - move N1Patcher to ICOL
  - move common MERIS stuff from ICOL & Co. into beam-gpf-meris
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN

* Need file and help menu items as in "old" processors
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN
* Need minimal developer guide  
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN
* Important issues with the band's source image:
  - dispose() method on MultiLevelImage shall not null its product node,
    use WeakReference instead.
  - Don't dispose source MultiLevelImage, if the RasterDataNode is not the
    owner, e.g. flag RasterDataNode.isSourceImageOwner()
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN

* Verify that Operator that terminate by throwing an exception and handled correctly. For all cases:
  [tile, tileStack] [gtp, graph, Visat]. Original problem reported by Luis Veci.
  ==> FINAL, MZ, CLOSED
* Done, enable/harmonise geo-coding transfer in all GPF ops  (see BEAM-1047 and BEAM-1050)  
  ==> FINAL, MP, CLOSED

SMOS-Box:
=========
* Export GridCellExporter still uses "product.getPinGroup().getSelectedNodes()" and ROIDefinition.
  ==> FINAL, *, OPEN
  
* We need the RasterDataNode.areaOfInterest:Geometry new property for boosting
  statistics computation and possibly also display. This property is optional but
  some product readers may set it, e.g. SMOS reader. Tile bounds can easily be
  tested for intersection with areaOfInterest and possibly ignored.
  Also very important for SMOS-Box 2.1
  ==> FINAL, RQ, CLOSED
* Pin table with band values is not updated when snapshot ID is changed
  ==> FINAL, RQ, CLOSED (needs to be tested by OF)
  (OF: the values in the Pin table are not always match values in the Pixel Info)
  (MZ: fixed)
* Speed up statistics for Stokes bands
  ==> FINAL, RQ, CLOSED (duplicated)

GlobToolbox
===========
* Create add on installer
  ==> FINAL, MP, OPEN

CHRIS-GeoCorrection
===================
* Auto-Download Telemetry
  ==> FINAL, RQ, OPEN
* NullPointerException after map-projection if not saved to file
  ==> FINAL, RQ, OPEN

Envisat Reprocessing 3:
=======================
* Format update
  Note: [BEAM-1070]
  ==> FINAL (v4.7.x), *, OPEN

Other BEAM/VISAT/API Stuff:
===========================
* When loading our OBPG Level-2 data products pixel times are not
  displayed and the No-Data Overlay doesn't work for missing data (e.g.
  after reprojecting L2 chlor_a, the missing pixels in the resulting map
  are not detected as missing)  (reported by Sean Bailey)
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN
  
* ProductIO: update Tutorial
** ProductIO.readProduct(..., PruductSubsetDef def) remove SubsetDef
** Product.setWriter(Writer)
** Product.writeHeader()
  ==> FINAL (after public release), MZ, OPEN  

* Auto-insert BlueMarble (if WSG-84 lat/lon) and Country shapes
  ==> FINAL (really?), *, OPEN
* Avoid adding too much node listeners to a product:
  - abstract ProductNode.handleRename(node, oldName, newName)
  - abstract ProductNode.handleNodeDataChanged(node, oldName, newName)
  ==> FINAL (really?), *, OPEN

* Generic GPF action
  ==> FINAL, MZ, CLOSED  
* Move PropertyPane and dependency to TableLayout into Ceres
  ==> FINAL, MZ, CLOSED
* ProductIO changes;
** ProductIO.readProduct(..., PruductSubsetDef def) remove SubsetDef

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// TODO put in Wiki

h2. API changes:

h3. Product Data Model Changes
* Introduced Mask class
* Introduced VectorDataNode class
* Product class
** Added new methods to Product class
**# ProductNodeGroup<VectorData> getVectorDataGroup()
**# ProductNodeGroup<Mask> getMaskGroup()
** Deprecated a lot of old methods dealing with {{BitRaster}} and bitmasks in general
** Change events for the following "properties" are not fired anymore: modified, owner 
* Added new methods to ProductVisitor interface:
*# void visit(Mask mask)
*# void visit(VectorDataNode dataNode)
* ProductNode class
** Rename updateExpression(s1, s2) to handleRename(node, s1, s2)  (TODO!)
* Rename 'Pin' into 'Placemark'.

h3. Ceres Binding API Changes

* Terminology changes followed by extensive renamings:
** ValueModel --> Property
** ValueDescriptor --> PropertyDescriptor
** ValueContainer --> PropertyContainer
** ValueAccessor --> PropertyAccessor
** ClassFieldDescriptorFactory --> PropertyDescriptorFactory
** ValueDescriptor.properties --> PropertyDescriptor.attributes (incl. all accessors)
* New interface PropertyAccessorFactory
* PropertyContainer.setValue(String propertyName, Object value) now throws IllegalArgumentException
 by wrapping a previously thrown ValidationException.

* PropertySet is an interface which has been extracted from PropertyContainer.
  Thus, in many places (including public BEAM API) the use of PropertyContainer has been replaced by PropertySet

* ValueEditor --> PropertyEditor
* ValueEditorRegistry --> PropertyEditorRegistry
* ValueEditorsPane --> PropertyPane
* Moved swing.binding packages between modules: ceres-binding:com.bc.ceres.binding.swing --> ceres-ui:com.bc.ceres.swing.binding


h3. Ceres Layer API Changes

* Renamed method LayerType.getConfigurationTemplate() to  createLayerConfig()
* Moved methods LayerType.createDefaultValueModel() ValueModel.createValueModel()

h3. Ceres Core API Changes
* Renamed class ServiceRegistryFactory to ServiceRegistryManager

h2. Operator changes

* Renamed source product alias in WriteOp from "input" to "source" for consistency.
